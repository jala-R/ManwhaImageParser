 in the a midst of a mountainous landscape. Under the bright daylight, a group of individuals stood together. Their gaze is fixated on a lone figure lying before them. On

 suoh a swordsman was down on the ground clutching his broken sword. He was visibly exhausted. His body battered and poisoned. His breathing labored.

 He looked up at the people that once he trusted the most in front of him. Frustration evident in his eyes. One of the people muttered something about him with a broken sword, trying to act tough, mocking Su ho struggle.

 Nearby, Alex Morgan, a warrior, looked at him, almost regretful. He thought it would have been much easier if Sumo had just joined them from the beginning. But he knew how stubborn public servants could be.

 Next to him, a girl agreed casually,

 Suzuki ando, a mage with a staff glowing with dark energy, commented with disdain. She remarked on the difference in talent, the inherent abilities that separated people like her from someone like Su Ho, who she referred to mockingly as a sword God.

 She added that she didn't like men in suits anyway, clearly expressing her dislike for people like him. Su Ho looked up at them, his eyes betraying the hurt inside.

 His mind traveled back to the times. They fought side by side

 together. They had fought and celebrated victories, smiling, feeling triumphant.

 And now they stood against him as if none of it mattered anymore.

 We have been fighting together all this time, he said, his voice trembling with emotion. He demanded to know how they could do this to him, why they were turning their backs on everything they had accomplished. His voice grew louder, more desperate, as he pleaded for answers.

 Isabela, the healer of the group, spoke with a flat expression. She said it was unfortunate, but unavoidable. Sue Ho was the only one opposing the current operation, the one who refused to fall in line.

 Sue Ho asked if they weren't ashamed of betraying everything they stood for.

 He reminded them that they had conquered one out of the five disaster gates. If they conquered the remaining four, humanity would be safe, free from the constant threat of monsters. But now they wanted to abandon the gate, to leave humanity in danger. He couldn't understand how they could choose this path. He accused them, saying they were no different from the monsters themselves.

 Hex herd, the group's archer, responded calmly. He pointed out that at least they didn't slaughter humans. He explained that if all the gates were conquered, hunters like them would lose their purpose.

 Once seen as heroes, they would be reduced to nothing more than thugs in the eyes of the people. Hex then spoke directly to Sue Ho, suggesting that he wouldn't want to become a target of fear.

 He tried to persuade him one last time, offering his hand and telling him to join them.

 Sue Ho's face twisted in anger. He felt betrayed and hexes words only added salt to his wounds. After everything they had done, Hex expected him to just join them as if nothing had happened.

 He rejected the offer, glaring at the group in defiance

 inside. Sue Ho knew he was running out of time. His body was poisoned by Suzuki's venom and the wounds inflicted on him were beyond healing.

 He understood that he wouldn't survive this fight.

 There was only one thing he could do. If he couldn't live. He could at least take one of them with him for the sake of humanity's future.

 With this thought, he gripped his broken sword, determination, lighting up his weary eyes.

 His last duty as a hero, he decided, would be to sacrifice himself, even if it meant taking just one enemy down. The group tensed as they sensed his resolve. Energy began swirling around him, his power surging as he stepped forward with purpose.

 Alex, standing with the group, was visibly confused, and Suzuki tried to reassure them. She dismissed SWO, saying he was merely bluffing. After all, he was just a swordsman wielding a broken weapon.

 However, Hex was not so sure. Something felt different. Something about Sumo's energy.

 The tension became palpable, and suddenly, with a burst of power, Sumo moved his sword, cutting through the air. The attack was swift and violent and it caught the group off guard. Suzuki was struck down instantly, her body falling lifeless. Li while Alex screamed in pain. His arm severed from his body.

 Hex acted quickly, saving himself and Isabela narrowly avoiding Sumo's strike. He marveled at the speed of the attack, knowing that if he had been even a moment late, he would have met the same fate.

 He wondered how Sumo managed to strike with such power. His sword was broken, his body poisoned. It didn't make sense.

 Alex was holding his left hand. His face twisted in agony as he tried to cope with the pain of his lost arm.

 Isabela rushed to his side. Her hands glowing with healing magic. But something was wrong.

 She looked at Alex's wound in shock. She couldn't heal it.

 Her eyes widened as she realized the truth. She had only heard of it before, but never seen it. The power surpassing the human realm that can't be healed with magic. The wound inflicted by sumo was beyond her abilities.

 Sumo, with his body battered and energy draining rapidly, looked at his sword as it began to glow. A brilliant aura surrounding it.

 Hex watching from a distance, finally understood it was an intangible sword. A weapon formed purely by willpower, a sword of energy.

 Sumo felt a sense of grim satisfaction as he realized that he had grasped it. The very thing he had been striving for, he had achieved the ultimate swordsmanship. Even in his final moments

 with a final surge of power. He smiled for the last time he fell, his body vanishing over the edge of the cliff

 as he fell. A system notification appeared in his mind. It congratulated him for reaching the realm of divine sword unity. The system praised him for his achievements, listing new abilities,

 and announced the rebooting of the player system.

 The world around sumo turned dark as he felt his life slip away. He had fulfilled his last mission, sacrificing everything to take down his foes. But the regret lingered in his heart. He felt that cold, inevitable pull toward

 death. Suddenly, the darkness faded, replaced by a blinding light that took on the form of a city. One unlike the battle worn cliffs where he'd met his end, Sumo opened his eyes disoriented. It wasn't the afterlife he expected. Instead, it was a bustling, chaotic, urban city.

 A firefighter appeared in his vision. His voice tense, but filled with urgency. The man told Sumo that he was injured and insisted on taking him to a safe zone.

 The mention of a gate outbreak made Su Ho's eyes widen. He thought for sure that he had died back in that dungeon

 as Sumo was carried through the streets. His gaze shifted around in confusion. Buildings towered over him, but he noticed the destruction.

 A massive explosion rumbled in the distance with debris flying across the street.

 The name of the place flashed before him as he looked at a station sign. It read syndrome.

 The familiarity of the names struck him hard. Sumo's thoughts spun in disbelief. Syndrome Station was a location that had once been lost, contaminated due to a gate outbreak. It had marked of one of humanity's darkest moments. Yet here he was witnessing the catastrophe all over again

 as he puzzled over a situation. A goblin appeared from the shadows of the gate. Sumo murmured the words. Syndrome. Station gate outbreak. Under his breath, feeling the sheer impossible pity of what he was seeing.

 Then, out of nowhere, an arrow cut through the air, striking the firefighter, carrying him.

 The man let out a strangled cry, collapsing on to the ground.

 The chaos around them grew louder with goblins screaming, their voices echoing and swallowed by the sounds of battle. The firefighter urged Sumo to run, pointing at the safe zone, he mentioned.

 Sumo's eyes narrowed. He spotted an ax nearby, leaning against a pile of debris without a second thought. He grabbed it. He knew he had to act. He couldn't afford to hesitate. Not now.

 Despite the firefighters frantic warnings. Sumo effortlessly swung the ax with precision, honed from countless battles,

 killed the Goblin in one hit.

 Afterward, Sumo looked at his hands, expecting wounds or the sting of injury. But there were none. His hands were steady, unbroken.

 A sudden realization began to dawn on him. This was just like before. Like when he had first awakened as a player.

 A system notification appeared in his mind, the words glowing vividly. It congratulated him for meeting the awakening conditions, urging him to become stronger.

 Sumo let out a laugh. One filled with equal parts, disbelief and amusement. The situation felt strangely familiar. Around him, the city lay damaged, with chaos unfolding in every corner.

 A notification then appeared, this time giving him a choice.

 On a digital screen floating in front of him. Four options glowed brightly. Warrior, mage, archer and healer.

 He stared at the options. Memories flooding his mind. He had faced this decision before long ago. He had chosen the path of a warrior without hesitation. Now he stood at the same crossroad once again.

 Sumo thought back to everything that had led him here. His instincts urged him to pick Warrior once more. But something held him back. He finally spoke aloud, asking the system to delay his selection. There was a different path to choose this time, and Sumo wasn't sure which direction his future would take.

 As the chaos of the city continued to echo around him, the firefighter called out to him, desperate to pull him away from danger. But Sumo stayed rooted in place. Sumo assured the firefighter that there was no need to worry. He confidently said he could handle the goblins alone. They were just goblins after all. The firefighter looked hesitant, but stepped back.

 Goblins with glowing eyes and crude weapons approached menacingly.

 Sumo readied himself. Standing tall amidst the chaos, he unleashed his power, rushing toward the goblins with the same unwavering determination he had always shown.

 His movements were swift. His eyes focused intensely on the enemy. He ran down a burning street, dodging attacks from the goblins with precision. Each step carried the weight of his experience. His body responding with muscle memory as he evaded blows.

 He spotted a red ax amidst the debris, picking it up and swinging it fiercely at the nearest goblin.

 The creature fell, and Sumo's resolve only grew stronger. He was ready for more.

 With a determined leap, he launched himself at another goblin, slashing through with precise and powerful strikes. It was as if Sumo had become a force of nature. His movements fluid and on hesitant. It truly was Goblin Slayer time.

 Standing over the fallen creatures, sumo remained calm and composed. He remarked to himself that goblins were only a threat to beginner players. It was nothing for someone like him.

 He glanced at the Goblin sword he had picked up. Testing its weight before declaring that he would cut them all down.

 A fierce battle ensued as sumo moved swiftly.

 The goblin sword in his hands, cutting down each enemy that dared to come near his strikes, were powerful and decisive, leaving no room for error. One by one, the goblins fell until there were none left standing

 Now, alone in the aftermath of the battle, Sumo paused, breathing heavily. His anger had not yet subsided. He realized he had gotten too excited, letting his emotions take over. He reminded himself that he needed to stay cool headed, especially in moments like this. Anger could cloud his judgment, and he couldn't afford that anymore.

 He looked around and a thought crossed his mind. If he wasn't mistaken, he had returned to the past for some reason. This was a clear opportunity, a chance to start over from scratch.

 He observed a series of holographic panels that suddenly appeared, displaying various achievements and skills. Basic swordsmanship skills were listed skills that he hadn't seen in a long time. Sumo smiled slightly, remembering those early days. It really was like starting over. The goblin sword he held was a bit short, but it would do for now.

 At that moment, the firefighter cautiously approached Sumo, still visibly shaken. The man stammered, asking if Sumo was a player. Sumo nodded, answering calmly. Ah, yes.

 Now, after all the fight, he knew the answer to his question before he made a selection on the holographic screen that hovered before him.

 The system prompted him to choose the power he wished to pursue. This time he chose the healer.

 A confirmation screen appeared congratulating him on his choice. He was awarded bonus stats and a new skill. Healing light F was added to his abilities.

 Sumo turned back to the firefighter, noticing the man's injuries. He moved closer, inspecting the wounds.

 He placed a gentle hand on the firefighters shoulder and spoke reassuring Lee. The firefighter looked confused but didn't resist.

 A blue aura surrounded them, both, indicating the activation of Sumo's healing power.

 Slowly, the wounds began to heal.

 The firefighters eyes widened in disbelief. He could barely stammer out words. Amazed that the pain had subsided completely, he asked Sumo if he was really a healer, and Sumo, with a faint smile, replied, I guess that's me now.

 Another system notification appeared, offering Sumo a small gift for using his first healing skill. He was given the choice to select a weapon from the system's arsenal. Sumo contemplated for a moment, though, he had chosen the healer class, but his main weapon would be the same.

 He summoned a glowing sword from the system's arsenal.

 It was a beginner's sword, but it would serve its purpose. He examined the sword, looking contemplative. There was still much to do, and his journey had only just begun.

 He turned his attention to the gate that loomed in the distance. He announced his intention to go and conquer the gate. The firefighter, alarmed, tried to stop him, warning him of the dangers, but Sumo remained unfazed. He assured the firefighter that he had something to gain from this

 as Sumo walked confidently toward the gate. Memories began to flood his mind. He remembered his past achievements, the skills he had acquired through hard work and dedication. Just like before, the skills gained through talent could be used regardless of class.

 But the innate skill that is bound to class like healing magic, is only for healers. He recalled Isabella's Holy Spirit light, remembering that it had begun as healing light.

 If only he could have healed his wounds back then. Things might have ended differently.

 Sumo knew that this time things had to be different. He would become both a swordsman and a healer. A paladin would be great, right? And he would prevent the same mistakes from happening again. He needed to grow stronger, faster than the others who had betrayed him.

 As he stood before the gate, he thought of those who had once been his allies, their indifferent faces lingering in his memory. He had to acquire skills faster to level up and surpass his past self.

 This gate, a premonition gate, had almost cost him his life in the past,

 but this time he was prepared. His skill level might be low now and it might be difficult, but that was okay. The swordsmanship that was engraved in his mind remained unchanged. He would start over and overcome

 with determination burning in his eyes. Sumo approached the glowing, colorful portal. The past had given him another chance, and he was ready to face the challenge ahead. It was time to rewrite his story.

 Sumo walked carefully through the dense, lush forest. His step splashing softly on the wet ground.

 He moved cautiously, scanning his surroundings with a sharp gaze. Always alert for any danger lurking nearby. The thick foliage brushed against him as he moved forward,

 and he noticed a creature lying still. The goblin's lifeless body lay on the ground. A testament to the chaos that had taken place.

 He remarked to himself that the goblins, which had been rampaging outside the gate as if they owned the world, were all dead inside the gate. He concluded that the goblins must have escaped through the gate, running away from something more terrifying.

 Suddenly, a noise interrupted the quiet and somehow froze his eyes, focusing in the direction of the sound. His instincts were right. The reason behind the goblins desperate escape. Soon became clear.

 Emerging from the shadows were two hobgoblins, their eyes glowing with hostility. One stood at level ten, the other at level 12. And they glared at sumo with menacing intent. Their skin was a bright red. Unlike the regular goblins,

 Sumo noted that these hobgoblins had larger bodies, stronger muscles and more menacing auras. They wanted to make him their prey, replacing the goblins that they had already hunted.

 Sumo smiled, unfazed by their hostility to him. They were still goblins. No matter their size or color.

 He stepped forward with confidence, bracing himself for the battle ahead. The clash began as Sumo's weapon collided with the hobgoblins.

 He moved skillfully, dodging their powerful strikes. But he noticed his own attacks barely grazed their tough skin. His current level wasn't enough to cut through their thick hide.

 Sumo decided that he needed to approach things differently if his strength alone wasn't enough. He had to find their weakness and exploit it.

 The fight grew more intense with each side refusing to back down. Eventually, Sumo realized he needed to change tactics. He knew that to beat them, he had to be smart, not just strong. He had to find an opening, a weak point.

 He soon found his opportunity with a powerful leap. He jumped into the air, raising his sword and struck down at one of the hobgoblins with precise force in the eye.

 The creature recoiled, and before Sumo could react, it collapsed at his feet. He looked down at the fallen hobgoblin, a little surprised he hadn't meant to kill it so quickly.

 He sighed, realizing he'd done it out of habit. He told himself he would have to be more careful next time. However, there was no time to dwell on his thoughts.

 A massive hobgoblin appeared in the distance, its muscles bulging as it charged toward him aggressively.

 Sumo's eyes narrowed. He couldn't afford to waste this opportunity. He decided to make use of the hobgoblin until he found another one.

 The creature lunged at him, but Sumo dodged nimbly, slipping away with smooth agility. He knew that repeating a certain action often enough could allow him to acquire a skill related to that action. If he kept avoiding the hobgoblins attacks like this, he might acquire the Dodge skill he needed.

 He continued to evade each movement sharper and more precise than the last.

 Finally, a system notification flashed in his mind. The system congratulated him for mastering Dodge.

 A sense of satisfaction filled sumo as he felt the newfound skill flowing through him. With Dodge mastered, his next focus was parrying.

 He raised his weapon and blocked the hobgoblins powerful strike with deft precision. Parrying was an essential skill the foundation for other important techniques, and Sumo was determined to master it.

 After several successful attempts, another notification appeared, announcing that he had now mastered Parry

 two. He looked at his opponent, noticing its stance wavering. Frustration was mounting in the creature, and Sumo knew it was time to finish this

 with a calm, yet confident demeanor to face the hobgoblin. He had gained what he needed. Now it was time to bring an end to the fight. He moved swiftly, his sword cutting through the air and the hobgoblin let out a strangled cry before collapsing to the ground.

 Sunlight filtered through the thick forest, illuminating the scene. Sumo looked down at his fallen opponent, knowing that he still had more work to do. There were more creatures out there and he needed to find them. Sumo then spoke aloud, his voice carrying through the forest. He was ready to earn experienced points in earnest. Now

 outside the gate. A few hunters gathered, visibly annoyed.

 One of them grumbled about someone barging into the gate without permission. They debated among themselves about which faction the one inside the gate belonged to. And one even commented that if that person ended up dying inside, it would become legendary.

 Elsewhere on a cracked city street, two men in suits were speaking with the firefighter before They seemed confused and frustrated, demanding information about the person who had entered the gate.

 The firefighter described Sumo, explaining that he was a beginner player who had dealt with a group of goblins alone and healed the firefighters wounds before entering the gate. The firefighter repeated Sumo's words that he had something to gain from it.

 The men in suits stood amidst the destruction on the city street. Goblin bodies scattered everywhere.

 One of them stared in disbelief, taking in the scene. They hadn't arrived late yet. The goblins had already been dealt with, and the person responsible was a healer. The thought seemed almost ridiculous to them, but the proof lay before their eyes.

 The goblin corpses and the healer who had gone into the gate alone. It was strange, too. Strange. He kept wondering who was the person inside the gate. He looked at the city again. His expression serious as he surveyed the remains of goblin corpses.

 He pondered aloud that the gate itself must not be too challenging if all the monsters dealt with were merely goblins. But even as he made that observation, his brow furrowed with worry. There was still the undeniable fact that the healer had entered alone. The scale of destruction around him painted an unusual picture, one that didn't fit with the typical abilities of a healer. Not a scratch on him. And yet the goblins had been eliminated easily. The man felt an uneasiness settle into his chest. He couldn't help but wonder what exactly that guy was thinking. It felt reckless, almost like the healer had rushed in without any clear plan. But the results spoke for themselves. And what if? Just what if the healer succeeded in clearing the gate?

 He turned to a subordinate nearby, urgency evident in his tone as he issued his orders. Any change in the gate had to be reported immediately, and if anyone emerged, they were to know at once.

 The subordinate nodded in acknowledgment, and the man in the suit took out his phone. His mindset. If that healer really managed to clear the gate, they had to make sure he ended up on their side. It was too risky to let someone of such potential slip away.

 The scene shifted back to Sumo into the dense enchanted forest,

 pseudo charged through the trees, his sword flashing as it sliced through hobgoblins, each strike precise and powerful.

 His movements left a trail of defeated foes, their bodies crumbling to the ground in his wake.

 He approached a hobgoblin that had stumbled back in terror, its eyes wide with fear.

 Sumo regarded the creature calmly, a hint of amusement, playing on his lips. He decided to let it go. He instructed the hobgoblin to bring more of its friends,

 and with a screech, the creature turned and fled into the forest. Sumo watched it go, then turned his attention to his stats.

 He opened the glowing status window and quickly scanned through his attributes.

 He thought it best to raise all stats evenly, believing balance to be key. He applied the bonus points, noting how many monsters he had defeated and how easily he had leveled up.

 A list of skill achievements appeared before him. Sumo examined the screen, his eyes skimming over the names thro Sidestep and others he had acquired. He had most of the basic skills now, but there was still more to do.

 He began searching the body, looking with a focused purpose, until he spotted what he was aiming for, a

 red crystal glowing faintly on the ground. He knelt and picked up the radiant magic stone, inspecting it with a satisfied nod.

 It was a grade stone, something that wouldn't have interested him in the past. But times had changed, and right now he needed the money. He estimated that he could sell it for 50,000 won.

 After some further searching, he managed to find another stone hidden among the dead hobgoblin, bringing a small smile to his face. This would be enough for now.

 Suddenly, sumo sensed movement. His body tensed as he readied his weapon. Shadows moved between the trees, signaling the arrival of more enemies.

 Su Ho muttered to himself, noting that if he took these down, the boss would probably show up

 around him. The forest filled with hobgoblins, their red eyes glinting with malice as they closed in

 Soho, counted about 30 of them, and he welcomed the opportunity to gain more experience before the real fight began.

 The hobgoblins lunged, but Sumo met them head on. He moved with skill and speed, dodging blows while striking back with deadly accuracy.

 His strikes were powerful, his sword cutting through his enemies with ease. The hobgoblins were relentless, but Sumo remained unfazed. He moved like a force of nature, determined to finish the fight quickly.

 The creatures fell one by one, each screeching in pain before collapsing

 in the midst of the battle. A sudden powerful swing came his way. A larger hobgoblin had joined the fray, its massive ax descending toward him. Sumo smiled as he parried the strike with ease. This was the one he'd been waiting for.

 The towering hobgoblin with its twisted expression and menacing aura, stepped forward. The forest around them, glowing with an ominous red hue, Soho's gaze locked onto the creature as the system notification flashed before his eyes. Chief Hobgoblin Level 20.

 He stood tall, drawing his sword, his confidence unwavering. The time had come to face the boss monster. Soho's expression was calm, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his lips. He was ready, and this battle was just the beginning of the story he intended to rewrite. He faced the chief hobgoblin with the same determination that had brought him to this moment. His mind set on one clear goal to become stronger and change his fate. Sumo stood there and looked at the Hobgoblin chief. He smirked while sensing the unease in the air as if the entire place was holding its breath, waiting for the chaos to begin.

 He then confronted a hobgoblin, Then chief, and the clash began without hesitation. Soho moved swiftly, meeting each attack with precision.

 The Hobgoblin chief was relentless. Its weapons swinging with savage force. But Sewell was calm and unfazed, listening to its frantic cries

 as the normal hobgoblin lunged in sneak attack from behind.

 Soho's body responded effortlessly, dodging and retaliating with rapid, precise strikes. The forest resonated with the sound of steel clashing and the cries of defeated demons.

 Sumo thought how these hobgoblins were mere small fries. He didn't want any of these nuisances to interrupt his real battle as he dealt with each one. He almost found it amusing. These creatures were no match for him.

 But then the atmosphere shifted as the Chief Hobgoblin used its skill.

 Suddenly, Sumo felt his entire body seize up as the system announced that the Chief Hobgoblin had used fear.

 The oppressive feeling wrapped around him like chains, locking his muscles. He understood the danger. The higher the enemy's level, the stronger the effect of this fear.

 It was a skill meant to paralyze him, to stop him in his tracks. He gritted his teeth, realizing he had nothing in his arsenal to counteract metal attacks like this. No skills, no items.

 But Sumo refused to be helpless, even without special abilities. He knew of a way to overcome it.

 His eyes hardened as he made his decision. His hands tightening around his sword's blade until blood flowed.

 The pain jolted him back to reality. His body responding as he willed himself to move

 the system, declared that he had broken free from the state of fear,

 and Sumo felt his resolve returned with a sudden, narrow dodge. He managed to evade the chief hobgoblin attack and delivered a swift counter.

 The creature seemed shocked at his resilience. But Sumo didn't pause.

 He quickly took care of the remaining small hobgoblins, striking them down one by one.

 The system acknowledged his success, notifying him that all the hobgoblins had been eliminated.

 Standing amidst the aftermath, Sumo invoked his healing energy. The forest briefly pulsed with a warm glow as healing light enveloped the area, restoring his body.

 He was far from done, though. The real battle was about to begin.

 The chief hobgoblin appeared again. Its menacing aura unmistakable. Its weapon reflecting the dim light.

 Sumo looked at it. His calm demeanor showing no

 fear. He was ready for a personal battle. Just the two of them.

 The fight was intense, with both combatants giving it their all. Sumo noted that the level gap was an obstacle. His attacks weren't dealing significant damage.

 Sumo focused on the chief, knowing that each strike counted and that the accumulation of small injuries would ultimately weaken his enemy.

 His blade shimmered slightly as he focused his energy, preparing for a decisive move. He aimed for the weak spots, exploiting the wounds he had already inflicted

 with a fierce lunge. He drove his sword deep into the hobgoblin, the creature letting out a pain scream.

 It tried once more to use fear against him.

 But Sumo was beyond that now. He had conquered fear once, and it could not control him again.

 He pressed on delivering blow after relentless blow. His expression, one of steely determination

 with one final powerful strike. Sumo ended the battle.

 The chief hobgoblins expression froze in shock as it fell. But Sumo wasn't done.

 He used his healing energy on the dying monster, forcing it back to life, only to fight it again and again.

 He repeated this until he was satisfied, until he had refined his skills further.

 The system notified him of his progress. Several of his skills had been upgraded. Their ranks rising and his power increased.

 Sumo looked at his hands, feeling the newfound strength coursing through him. The time had come for the hobgoblins roll to end.

 With a grim smile, he delivered the final blow, decapitating the creature.

 The system confirmed his victory. The chief hobgoblin was dead.

 The gate had been conquered and Sumo was named the MVP. He felt a surge of energy as he leveled up. All his stats improving and bonus points were awarded to him. Numerous screens filled his vision, announcing new skills and abilities.

 Healing light had been upgraded and a new skill cure had been acquired.

 Sumo allowed himself a small smile. Now there was no need to fear status ailments. Eventually, he would become strong enough to cure even the most potent poisons.

 He looked at the glowing man, a stone from the fallen boss, feeling satisfied. He had gotten everything he needed from this place. It was time to move on.

 He thought about the familiar faces he hadn't seen in a long time. He felt a twinge of anticipation

 outside the gate. The world was in turmoil. People gathered below their faces, a mix of fear and awe as the gates shook.

 Whispers of uncertainty spread through the crowd as a bright light appeared and a figure began to step out. All eyes were on the gate as they wondered who or what was coming back

 to her. Walked out of the gate with an air of confidence, his entire presence radiating a strong and mysterious energy.

 The people around couldn't help but murmur in amazement. They wondered if he had actually managed to conquer the gate alone. The crowd was filled with disbelief and the question of whether he truly was alone echoed repeatedly. Among them, many Scout frantically approached Sumo, trying to catch his attention. They introduced themselves from the Immortal Guild. Another one representing the Warren Guild. And they all attempted to introduce themselves and wanted to scout him.

 However, Sumo simply ignored him, leaping down decisively and landing smoothly before the crowd.

 He moved forward with purpose

 until he reached a man in a suit, extending his hand confidently.

 The man seemed puzzled by the sudden interaction. Sumo greeted him and it turned out that the man was young. Chilman. The team leader of the South Korean Hunter Association, another man in a suit standing next to Chilman, asked if he knew Su Ho, but Chilman admitted that he had no idea who this person was. He was genuinely confused.

 Later, as the sun began to set, the scene shifted to the large building labeled as the South Korean Hunter Association.

 In an there. Jung Chul Min sat at his desk facing Su ho

 Chilman appeared deep in thought, trying to recall their first meeting.

 He remembered when Su ho confidently greeted him and shook his hand. Sue Ho had introduced himself and then stated that he had business with the association, mentioning that he was planning to get a hunter's license.

 Chilman was taken aback. Issuing a hunter's license was no small matter, and from what he could gather, this wasn't even a license renewal. It appeared that Sue Ho was an unregistered hunter,

 too. Means thoughts focused on what that meant. Sue Ho was a newly awakened player, and considering his abilities, it was surprising. Healer class was often considered the weakest among the four main class categories. Yet Sue Ho had conquered a gate alone.

 As he examined Su Ho's Hunter aptitude test results, it seemed more like the results of a warrior than a healer. This intrigued him.

 Sue Ho remained calm, even casual, as he ate something while waiting for Tillman's response.

 Sue Ho, noticing Shulman's hesitation while examining the results, asked if there was an issue. But Chilman said there was nothing to worry about.

 Chilman confirmed su ho's name en su ho and began inquiring about his background. He was curious about what Su Ho had done before becoming a hunter. Sue Ho admitted he was just a college dropout.

 When Chilman asked further, Sue Ho explained he hadn't done well in college. He smiled lightly, making the statement seem less serious. Chilman wondered if he had been a medical student. But Su Ho revealed that he had studied physical education instead.

 This confused chilman even more. Typically, people who chose to be healers came from medical backgrounds. Choosing to be a healer despite having a physical education background seemed unusual. Chilman then asked why Su ho chose the healer path instead of becoming a warrior or an archer.

 Sue Ho smiled again, revealing that he hated getting hurt. This reason was simple, yet unconventional, which amused Chilman. He couldn't hold back his curiosity any longer. He asked to ho how he had managed to conquer the gate alone.

 Sue Ho reflected on the past events, remembering the battle with the hobgoblin. He explained that there wasn't much of a plan or strategy when he entered the gate. A hobgoblin had attacked him and he fought back just to survive. Chilman was startled when he heard the mention the hobgoblin

 Sue Ho confirmed it was indeed a hobgoblin and proceeded to open his inventory

 in an instant. Glowing magic crystals appeared. He placed them on the table, explaining that he had obtained them by killing not only a hobgoblin, but also its chief,

 Sue, who admitted that he didn't really know the value of these magic crystals. So he asked Chilman to handle them.

 Chilman still processing what he had heard, agreed to take care of it. He grabbed one of the crystals and began preparing it for processing. Despite his shock, he focused on the task at hand.

 He then turned to Sue Ho, asking if he was truly committed to becoming a hunter

 and Su Ho confidently confirmed that he was. He had made that decision the moment he awakened as a player.

 Chilman couldn't help but comment on how significant that decision. However, in his mind he found it to be somewhat impulsive. He asked Sue Ho if there was a particular reason behind his choice.

 Sue Ho smiled, observed that Chilman was not very good at hiding his thoughts. The conversation became more serious as Sumo shared his reason for wanting to become a hunter.

 He explained that he had lost his entire family because of gate shock. He hated monsters and Gates deeply, and he thought that becoming a hunter could help him fight back. He admitted that entering the gate alone had been an emotional choice, driven by a desire to ease his own frustration. However, killing the monsters had not given him the relief he sought. The clots in his heart were still there.

 Sue Ho realized that his purpose was more than just killing monsters. He wanted to ensure that no one else would have to go through what he had experienced. He wanted to protect people from losing their loved ones to monsters with a serious expression. He stated that he wanted to work for everyone's safety.

 Chilman looked at Sue Ho with a sense of honor. Suhail was determined and his purpose was clear.

 He wanted to become a hunter of the South Korean Hunter Association, not just for himself, but for the greater good. His expression was firm, signaling that this was a significant and final decision.

 Chilman explained to Sue Ho that becoming part of the Hunter Association meant living as a civil servant. Hunter, he pointed out with a hint of hesitancy that their pay was considerably lower compared to what hunters earned in private guilds. It wasn't just a little less, it was quite a significant difference.

 Sue Ho listened attentively. His expression remaining calm but resolute when it was his turn to speak. He made it clear that he already knew about the lower pay. But for him, what mattered more than the money was something different. He valued free access to various gates. The priority to conquer them and the authority that came with being part of the South Korean Hunter Association. Additionally, he sought the power to impose strict punishment for player crimes, something that only the association could truly offer.

 Tillman blinked at Sue Ho's words. Genuinely curious. He asked what exactly Sue Ho meant by wanting those privileges. He then thought to himself that most people would probably prefer to work in an office rather than going out to conquer Gates.

 Chilman leaned back, surprised by what he was hearing. Thinking aloud if something like this was even possible.

 Chilman clarified that in reality, while the Hunter Association did indeed have the rights to conquer various gates, those rights were often auctioned off to private guilds.

 The reasoning was simple There was no logic in risking one's life to attack dangerous gates for a low government salary.

 He continued, saying that people often spoke of becoming a hunter civil servant as a form of altruism.

 However, most people aimed for it because it was a stable job where they could make a living without entering gates, working in administrative roles instead. Most civil servants, he said, would do anything to avoid entering the gates.

 However, on Su Ho was different. Su Ho wasn't just interested in the stability or the pay. He spoke of public safety and he was someone willing to work directly in the field.

 Chilman found himself in awe.

 He saw Sumo as an ideal civil servant hunter, someone who truly cared about protecting people. An embodiment of patriotism. He was perfect in that sense.

 Chilman couldn't help but feel overwhelmed. He admitted, half jokingly, that he was so happy it made him feel dizzy.

 Sue Ho, seeing Tillman's reaction, leaned forward with concern, asking if he was all right. Chilman quickly composed himself, clearing his throat and adjusting his demeanor. He admitted that it had been a long time since he had met someone like Sue Ho. He assured him that he would handle the paperwork and ID needed. Chilman then explained that to officially join Sue, Ho would need to complete the Hunter exam, which included an aptitude test, a written exam, and a practical exam. However, there was a catch with a slightly troubled expression. Chilman revealed that registration for the current years exam had already closed and that the exam day was actually tomorrow.

 Sue Ho's eyes widened in shock, but before the worry could fully take over,

 Chilman remained composed and smiled confidently. He assured Sue Ho that if he was interested, he could still register him as an exception.

 Sue Host face lit up in excitement and he quickly asked if that was really possible.

 Chilman nodded, explaining that this was within the existing rules since Sue Ho had managed to conquer a gate alone. They could report the matter to the higher ups and get approval for his late registration.

 Chilman shifted, his tone, becoming more serious. He admitted that he had recommended Sue Ho because he clearly had talent. But he also pointed out that preparing for both the written and practical exams with just one day would be extremely challenging. He was worried about Sue Ho's physical performance given his outstanding skills, but he did have some concerns about the written part.

 Sue Ho tightened his fist a clear display of his unwavering resolve. Chilman, still looking concerned, reiterated his worry about the written test. But Sue Ho only leaned forward, his tone strong and encouraging. He asked Chilman to please go ahead and register him, assuring him that he was ready for the challenge. Chilman blinked in surprise, but nodded as Sue. Ho continued speaking. Sue Ho said it was a good idea to take the exam at least once for the experience, especially when he had the chance. He added that it was just a test and if he failed, he could always take it again the next time.

 Chilman couldn't help but admire Sue Ho's bravery, and with a slight smirk, he shook his head, remarking on what a brave man Sue Ho was. Chilman then informed Sue Ho that he could check his aptitude test result today.

 Sue Ho thanked him for the information. But he hesitated for a moment before admitting that he didn't have the money for the registration fees. He asked if Chilman could handle the magic crystal transaction immediately.

 Chilman nodded quickly, adjusting his tie as he did so, and promised to take care of it while also checking Sue Ho's aptitude test.

 As Chilman left to take care of the necessary steps, the atmosphere softened and Su ho found himself reflecting inwardly. His face grew thoughtful against a chilman back in his heart. Sue Ho realized that even now, the only person he could truly trust was Chilman.

 His face then lit up with a grateful smile and he thanked Chilman sincerely.

 A while later, the two sat together, sharing a meal. Chilman announced that all the aptitude tests were finished and that he had deposited the money from the magic crystal. Sue Ho, still marveling at the situation. Exclaimed in disbelief when he saw the amount around 3,000,001. He took a sip from his drink and his tone turned playful. Chilman admitted, a bit embarrassed that as a civil servant hunter, he received certain tax exemption benefits specifically for magic crystals. Sue Ho's eyes widened and he asked excitedly if it was really duty free. Clearly impressed.

 He then turned to Chilman with a hopeful look and asked if he could ask for one more favor. Chilman curious. Asked what it was.

 Sue Ho explained that he had heard the association had a library. One that contained workbooks and reference materials related to the upcoming test,

 though it was already late and with the test being the next day, Sue Ho felt he needed to cram as much as possible.

 He hesitated briefly before speaking more firmly, asking if it would be all right for him to prepare for the exam in the library.

 Chilman broke into a wide, enthusiastic smile, raising both of their drinks in excitement. He enthusiastically told Sue Ho that, of course, he could use the library. Sue Ho's face brightened and he thanked Chilman once again.

 The next scene unfolded in brightly lit library with Chilman proudly gesturing at the vast collection of books. He informed Sue Ho that he didn't need an employee card when he left so he could feel free to study there as long as he needed.

 With a cheerful wave, Chilman wished Sue Ho the best of luck on his test tomorrow and walked away, leaving Sue Ho in quiet contemplation among the towering shelves of books

 as Chilman walked away. Sue, who watched him, his gaze softening with a mix of admiration and guilt.

 He muttered to himself that Brother Chilman was still the same as before, always a kind and trustworthy brother.

 Su Ho thought to himself that Chilman didn't know yet, but he would one day become the president of the Association.

 Sue Ho sighed, admitting it had been hard pretending to know nothing. He felt as though he had been teasing Chilman, but he knew that acting like he already knew everything would make Chilman suspicious.

 He rose from his seat, his expression hardening with determination as he walked deeper into the library. The sunset cast a golden glow through the library windows illuminating the rows of tall shelves. Suhail whispered to himself that it was time to find that

 thing. As he navigated the labyrinthine aisles, scanning the spines of countless books, he remembered the major events that would happen in the future. But he knew he couldn't remember every single detail. After all, he was only human.

 He stopped at a particular shelf, pulling out a large, ancient looking tome adorned with intricate patterns.

 He couldn't help but comment on how big it was.

 Soho opened the book, revealing pages filled with cryptic symbols and foreign text. He recalled how he had once tried to get information from this book before as he stared at the pages. The text began to glow softly, and a message appeared.

 The system informed him that the book was from another world.

 Sue Ho noted that a simple sentence had appeared, and there seemed to be separate ways to use the book. Sue Ho held the book aloft, an aura of mystery surrounding him as the symbol shimmered.

 He then put the book on his head, but after a while, frustration evident on his face as he muttered Why it wasn't working.

 It was said that this was the only way to use it. Yet nothing seemed to happen.

 Just then, a notification glowed in the air and the system announced that the Library of Memories was interested in his story. The book's pages turned on their own, glowing with a purple light that flooded the room.

 The system continued, stating that the Library of Memories was inviting him.

 The book radiated an intense, magical glow as Sue Ho stared in awe.

 Finally, the system declared, Welcome to the Library of Memories.

 The Library of memories opened before Sue Ho, its grand book, releasing a wave of shimmering magic that filled the vast space with blinding light. Sue Ho stood still, absorbing the significance of what he was about to gain.

 The book was an artifact that could make a person remember everything they had seen and heard. Even those painful memories that most people would rather forget.

 Sue Ho knew that the human mind relied on the process of forgetting to survive. Endless, vivid memories could be overwhelming after all. And yet he was willing to take on that burden. He understood that obtaining the library of memories came with a price. The curse of remembering everything but that curse was exactly what he needed. He was ready to take on even the painful moments to achieve his goals.

 He remembered that the one who was supposed to get the skill was a girl who would be Hexagon Guild manager. She had originally been an employee of the Korean Hunter Association before joining the Hexagon Guild. He recalled the story of how she had accidentally acquired the skill of the Library of Memories,

 how late one night, while studying in a library, she used the book as a pillow because sleeping face down was uncomfortable. By some stroke of luck, she had obtained the ability

 to have thought about how he had gotten this information thanks to her, and smiled. Already planning to buy her a meal the next time he saw her, he felt she deserved at least that

 suddenly a glowing system notification appeared in front of him. The system wanted to know if Sue Ho would be willing to donate his story to the Library of Memories.

 He hesitated for a moment, reflecting on the incredible power now within his grasp, the library could store everything, even the fleeting, overlooked details of his past, the things that might otherwise fade away.

 He clenched his fist with resolve and decided to accept the offer.

 A burst of radiant light engulfed him as the library began to record his story.

 Books floated around him, their covers glowing with arcane symbols. The entire space seemed to hum with energy as if alive with the magic of countless stories.

 A digital message appeared before him, confirming the skills functionality. The system explained that the Library of Memories would store all memories that he had seen and heard, allowing him to access them at any time. The Library of Memories would also recommend necessary information to the user.

 Sue Ho grimaced slightly, holding his head as he felt a strange sensation wash over him. The recording process was unlike anything he'd experienced before, an odd, disorienting sensation that made his head spin for a moment. He took a deep breath, steadying himself. He wondered if the recording process felt strange because it was an illusionary space.

 But now that he had the skill, he wanted to test it out. He thought about going back to the past, and immediately the world around him dissolved into a swirling vortex of past events.

 Flashes of his last battle appeared before him. The intensity of those moments still palpable. He could feel the raw emotion, the pain, the anger. As if it were happening all over again.

 He thought about his last moments and how he could still feel the emotions from that time. He watched the memories accelerate

 the betrayal of those he once called comrades. The struggle, the hatred that had burned within their eyes. The memories were vivid, painful, and utterly real. He clenched his jaw, his eyes narrowing. He thought about those selfish traders who had prevented the end of the gate just to have power a little longer. The memory of their faces flashed before him, those cold, indifferent expressions.

 He vowed never to forget them, his gaze hardening with the hurt and betrayal clear in his eyes.

 He leaned back, scowling faintly. It was unpleasant, and he regretted not having thought of something else.

 Just then, a new interface lit up in front of him an unexpected system notification, displaying cryptic information. Sue Ho frowned, squinting at the message. He wondered what this was. Confusion etched across his face.

 The panel shifted and a new message appeared. The system announced that it wanted to grant him the opportunity to become stronger as the first to reach the realm of the transcendent and that it would be rebooting the system of player on sumo.

 Sumo stood firm. His silhouette highlighted by the swirling light around him. The word rebooting echoed in his ears, and he felt a chill run down his spine. He could hardly believe it.

 As the light began to fade, Sumo found himself back in the massive library. The shelves around him glimmered with latent power, the accumulated knowledge of countless lives and experiences.

 He slowly nodded to himself. The realization dawning on him. The system had sent him back to the past. He recalled reaching the unity of the Divine Sword, acquiring his first SS grade skill, only to find himself here again, standing at the beginning.

 His expression turned contemplative as he stroked his chin thoughtfully, since he was the first to reach the state of the transcendent. The system was giving him another opportunity, something he had never even heard of before. He wondered if it was really a coincidence that he had come back to the past.

 He clenched his fists, his expression resolute as he sat in the back of a taxi heading to his destination.

 After getting out of the taxi. He continued walking, clenching his fists with determination.

 Whatever the reason was, the important thing was that he had returned to the past. This meant that not only could he prevent what had happened to him, but he could also suppress the initial chaos of the unpredictable gates, which had caused enormous casualties. He took a deep breath, his focus unwavering and resolved to give it a try. His gaze hardened with purpose. He thought that perhaps he could conquer the gates much faster than in his past life,

 so he couldn't

 afford to waste any of his precious time. Soon, he found himself standing before a grand building illuminated against

 the night sky. The sign above it glowed like a beacon. Nexus

 Soho's eyes narrowed with intent as he recognized the private Hunter Academy nexus.

 Inside the brightly lit reception area of Nexus, Soho walked confidently to the front desk. The receptionist smiled, politely, greeting him and asking what brought him there that day.

 Soho calmly stated that he wanted to meet director Kim Sue. The receptionist eyebrows rose slightly as she asked if he had scheduled a separate appointment. Soho explained that he hadn't made an appointment, but that he had something to discuss with the director.

 The receptionist expression turned apologetic as she informed him that an appointment was necessary.

 Sue Ho paused thoughtfully, then raised his hand as if an idea had struck him. He asked if she could just pass along a message, telling her that the solo conquerer of the Durham station Pre Catastrophe Gate was there.

 The receptionist's eyes widened briefly in shock, and she quickly nodded, picking up the phone to make the call.

 The scene transitioned to a hallway leading to a door labeled director's office

 inside. Director Kim Sui, a composed and elegant woman, stood behind a sleek desk. She greeted Sue Ho politely when he entered, introducing herself as the director of Nexus Academy.

 Sue Ho returned the introduction and sat down as she gestured to the chair across from her.

 The two sat across from each other. The atmosphere kind of backward, yet charged with mutual curiosity. Director Kim spoke first, mentioning that she had heard about him being the solo conquerer of the sender in Pre Catastrophe Gate and asked what brought him to Nexus.

 Sue Ho didn't hesitate, explaining that he had come to ask for a scholarship.

 Director Kim raised an eyebrow. Clearly surprised by his request, Sue Ho continued, stating that there was a Hunter license test scheduled for the following day and that he planned to take it as well.

 Director Kim looked momentarily startled and asked how long it had been since his awakening. When Sue Ho replied that it had happened to that very day.

 Director Kim's eyes widened in disbelief. She quickly flipped through a set of documents on her desk, stammering as she tried to process what she had just heard. She asked if she understood correctly that he was an unregistered hunter who had awakened that day and yet would be taking the Hunter license test tomorrow, all while being the solo rater of the pre catastrophe gate in syndrome.

 Sue Ho nodded, his expression calm as he confirmed her understanding in his mind. He recalled how he had been fortunate enough to have a connection at the Hunter Association, who helped him secure a spot for the test.

 Director Kim leaned back, her gaze sharpening as she regarded Sue Ho.

 Sue Ho confidently stated that he planned to aim for the top position in the test

 if he succeeded in passing as the top candidate. He requested that she grant him the status of a Nexus scholarships Student director. Kim considered his words, her eyes narrowing slightly as she weighed the proposal. After a moment she agreed, her voice carrying both a challenge and interest, implying that a scholarship would be appropriate if he succeeded. The two locked eyes, the room falling silent. Both radiated fierce determination, but neither willing to back down. There was an unspoken agreement between them, a challenge that each was willing to meet. The weight of their conviction hung in the air and Sue Ho knew that this was only the beginning of the path he intended to carve.

 Sue Ho spoke confidently, suggesting that Director Kim should really provide a scholarship.

 He looked sure of himself, even though it might be difficult for a complete rookie to become the top in the exam. But he wasn't just a rookie. He was a veteran who had conquered countless gates.

 Well, but now it was up to the director, whether to believe him or not.

 Director Kim adjusted her glasses and pointed out the challenges ahead, noting that the Hunter test was very different from conquering a gate, even an unprecedented one.

 She showed Su Ho a report containing the statistics of the Hunter test. She explained that the average passing rate was less than 20% and this year's passing rate was just 15%.

 Sue Ho only smiled at this. He then offered a suggestion If he did not come in first, she could just disregard him and forget about the scholarship payment. Director Kim paused for a moment, then asked him a question. She wanted to know why,

 among other academies like Hexagon and Prime Sue Ho had chosen Nexis.

 Sue Ho explained that it was because Nexis was in the most regrettable situation. Director Kim blinked at his unexpected answer. Maybe she wanted to slap him in the face,

 Sue Ho elaborated, saying that Nexis Academy was the largest in the country, but in recent years it had failed to produce a first, second place winner, and the number of students was decreasing noticeably.

 Director Kim sighed, acknowledging that, sadly, it was true. As Director Kim adjusted her glasses thoughtfully, she considered the implications of Su Ho's proposal. They needed to start showing results, but there wasn't an outstanding student who had grown significantly.

 What if she accepted Su Ho's offer and he really did come out on top?

 The lone conquerer of the syndrome station gate who passed the Hunter test with the highest score on Sue Ho.

 If this news spread, Nexis Academy would benefit greatly. It was an appealing proposal. There was just one thing left to address. Director Kim asked Sue Ho how much money he expected from the scholarship.

 He then asked how much the top student scholarship was. Director Kim explained that it was a full refund of the tuition fees for that year, along with an additional 30 million won as a congratulatory bonus. Furthermore, the top student would have the option to join the Nexus Guild immediately if they desired.

 Sue Ho nodded in appreciation. As expected from the largest academy, however, Director Kim suspected that Sue Ho might not have expected so much. She asked him with a casual tone how much he would honestly like

 Sue Ho thought for a moment and then smiled. He suggested 300 million won, considering the benefits that came with passing as the top student and the size of the academy. He pointed out that 300 million won wasn't much for Nexus Academy.

 Director Kim looked a bit taken aback by the amount, but eventually nodded, agreeing to his terms. All right. Director Kim said, nodding. She offered Su Ho a proposition if he passed as the top test taker. She would pay him the 300 million won.

 She suggested they draft a contract and for now, asked Sue Ho to look around the academy.

 The scene transitioned to a new location near a clock tower as the evening turned tonight. Sue Ho took in the sight of the expansive academy grounds and thought about how massive Nexis was. It seemed even larger than an amusement park. Once he enrolled, he knew he wouldn't lack anything

 nearby. Another man laughed. Clearly excited about the academy, mentioning that it was the largest academy in South Korea

 as Sue Ho in the man Walk together, Sue Host thoughts wandered. He noticed someone far off in the distance, training on the playground.

 It was hard to see clearly, but it looked like a student. The man guiding him commented that it was Deon, the most dedicated student. Sue Ho raised an eyebrow and asked, Is he training like that every day? The man nodded, confirming that day had trained at this hour regularly. Sue Ho watched as Deon practiced with a weapon, swinging it with precision.

 The man guiding Sue Ho called out today, Hun, reminding him that practice was important, but that he also needed to take care of his body.

 Dean turned toward them, smiling confidently as he replied that being a third year student, he needed to work even harder. Sue Ho observed Deon and recognized him immediately.

 He remembered forming grade parties with Darren in his previous life. Back then, Deion had become the top tanker in the country, known for his immense mental strength and defense. It was unfortunate that the role of pure tankers had declined over time.

 Sue Ho's gaze fell on the battle ax Deon was wielding. It was different from the shield that had suited him so well in the past. It seemed that Deion had yet to find his true calling.

 Sue Ho decided that this was an opportunity since Deon would eventually join Nexus in the future. Sue Ho thought it would be wise to build a connection with him now and later bring him into the Korean Hunter Association.

 Sue Ho smiled and introduced himself as on Sue Ho. They exchanged greetings and Sue Ho looked at the battle ax Deon held

 with curiosity. He asked if Dayan planned to use the ax as his weapon.

 Dayan looked a bit unsure, but explained with enthusiasm that he aimed to be a melee user.

 He had consulted others and they had recommended the battle ax. They had said that such weapons needed to suit one's physique from the start. And in terms of destructive power, nothing could match the battle ax.

 Sue Ho asked if Dayan had only been using the battle ax,

 and Dayan nodded, admitting that he was a bit of a slow learner and that it had taken him two years to become proficient with it. Sue Ho lost his word, suddenly felt a slight headache

 internally. He thought that the problem was that the battle ax didn't fit Dayan's aptitude at all. He couldn't tell if it was perseverance or just stubbornness. But Dayan should have tried switching weapons if his proficiency wasn't improving from the start. Dayan looked at Sue Ho curiously, sensing his contemplation and asked if there was any problem. Sue Ho had a serious yet contemplated expression as he thought to himself that the largest academy in the country was surprisingly lax.

 He then spoke up, suggesting that Dayan use a weapon he felt comfortable handling. After all, players would receive stab adjustments and with the skill correction effect, one could quickly increase proficiency. Sue Ho noted that the battle ax didn't seem to suit Dayan.

 Dayan seemed confused and Su Ho elaborated that the fact it had taken Dayan two years to become proficient with the battle ax indicated a lack of synergy.

 He explained that while the battle ax had high destructive power, the gap that occurred after an attack was too long. If there were no countermeasures to handle that interval, Dayan would be vulnerable to counter attacks.

 Moreover, Sue Ho pointed out that Dayan size was too large to be protected by a tank If he wielded a cumbersome weapon like the battle ax.

 Dayan was surprised by Su Ho's assessment. He admitted that he had been using the battle ax for three years now, and it felt like all that time might have been wasted.

 Sue Ho reassured him, saying that if Dayan had the perseverance to handle an unsuitable weapon for that long, his true aptitude might be closer to that of a tank.

 A tank? Dayan repeated, clearly surprised Sue.

 Ho nodded and suggested that Dayan should wear a kite shield on his left arm and hold a one handed bludgeon in his right hand. He added that Dayan's practical scores would likely improve significantly if he made the switch.

 Dayan hesitated, asking if it wasn't too late to change positions, especially with the test being the next day. Sue Ho asked him what he thought was the core of a party. Dayan guessed it was the mage, but Su Ho shook his head.

 He explained that the core of a party was the tank who had to draw aggro and protect the mage and healer for the party to function properly.

 Sue, who encouraged Dayan to wield a shield and use another primary weapon besides the shield to use crowd control in various ways.

 Dayan nodded slowly. Su Ho's words making sense to him. Dayan smiled and said he would give it a try. Sue Ho praised him for not being discouraged and for making rational decisions quickly.

 Dayan thanked Sue Ho and walked away, determined to practice

 as Han left the man guiding Sue Ho turned to him and asked if he was an instructor.

 Sue Ho looked surprised and shook his head, saying he wasn't. The man commented that Sue Ho seemed to have a deep understanding of weapon synergy and hunter advice, which was unusual for someone without a license. Sue Ho smiled and replied that he was not an instructor, but knew a bit in that area. Sue Ho, wanting to change the conversation. Asked if the contract ready, noting that some time had passed.

 The man nodded. Informed him that he had just received a call about it and suggested they head back to the director's office.

 The scene transitioned to the next day under a clear morning sky.

 The South Korea Hunter Association was bustling with examinees, all holding their weapons and preparing for the Hunter's license test. Everyone seemed to be in peak condition except for one man

 on Ho. The lone conqueror of the gate sat looking exhausted. He muttered to himself that he was tired from wandering around too much the previous day.

 He could see many people gathered there. Candidates were lined up awaiting their turn for the preliminary drug test, which was intended to catch any instances of doping. The announcers voice echoed the facility, instructing everyone to line up by their assigned numbers.

 Sue Ho, already weary from the demands of the day, sighed inwardly as he rubbed his temple. Even though the doping test was necessary, it felt like an extra burden added to an already grueling schedule.

 He looked up his eyes momentarily glowing blue, an indication of his special ability.

 Sue Ho knew that drug tests alone wouldn't detect everything. Those who cheated often relied on skill buffs rather than conventional drugs to gain an unfair advantage.

 His eyes swept across the room and he noticed a glow around several individuals, suggesting they had been buffed well beyond the typical level five of a test taker. These weren't just average candidates. Their magical energy was far too strong because of the buff.

 A system notification flashed before his eyes, congratulating him on mastering magic detection. Rank B. The newfound skill gave him a heightened sense of perception, making it even easier to identify those attempting to cheat.

 Ho frowned. His darkening. It was disappointing to see so many people abusing buffs, even though the use of such abilities for cheating hadn't yet become a widely known issue. He decided at that moment that something had to be done about it.

 Sue Ho's eyes wandered up to the balcony where he caught sight of Team Leader Jung Shulman, waving enthusiastically at him.

 Sue Ho allowed himself a small smile. At least there was one person here he knew he could trust.

 While Sue Ho waited, he overheard some of the other candidates talking among themselves. They were lamenting the difficulty of the written exam with one expressing worry about needing to retake it. Another nodded in agreement, describing the exam as insanely difficult.

 Sue Ho couldn't help but feel a little smug. Thanks to the library of memories, he had breezed through it without issue. He almost felt like a cheater himself. Though it was for different reason,

 a familiar voice called out to him, snapping him out of his thoughts.

 He looked up to see Chilman approaching his expression warm and friendly. Chilman wanted to know how the test had gone. Clearly curious.

 Sue Ho just shrugged, mentioning that he thought he could pass it.

 Chilman chuckled, commenting on Sue Ho's confidence. Apparently word had spread that this year's written exam had been the hardest yet. He then mentioned something more serious. Referring to Sue Ho's earlier comment about buff checks, he wanted to know what Sue Ho had meant by that.

 Sue Ho nodded thoughtfully. He explained that while there were measures in place to prevent doping, urine tests, blood tests and confiscation of belongings,

 he had noticed that there were no checks specifically for skill related cheating. He suggested that conducting a magic detection scan might help identify those using illegal buffs.

 Schulman's eyes widened slightly and he thanked Sue Ho for the information. Promising to look into it before the practical test began

 as he turned to leave. He paused and looked back at Sue Ho. Chilman expressed that he personally hoped Sue Ho would succeed, mentioning how much he would like to work with him in the association. He encouraged Sue Ho to do his best in the practical test.

 Sue Ho nodded, appreciating the encouragement. It felt to have someone rooting for him.

 The loudspeaker crackled to life drawing everyone's attention. The announcement informed the candidates that the test would be postponed by 2 hours due to dive capsule issues.

 They were instructed to have lunch in the cafeteria and wait in the lounge or training area for a while. Sue Ho allowed himself sigh of relief. The delay would give Chilman time to implement the buff check, which might mean a cleaner, fairer test for everyone.

 With 1200 candidates a passing rate below 10%. Sue Ho estimated that the cheater purge might reduce it even further, down to 7% or so. But

 that would mean that those who passed were truly the best. And Sue Ho like the idea of being surrounded by pure, top notch talent. He decided to use the extra time to keep an eye on the other candidates. Maybe there be someone among them worth noticing.

 Suddenly, Sue Ho's attention was pulled away by the sound of a commotion.

 A young man was approaching a much larger candidate, challenging him to a sparring match. The young man was loud enough to draw everyone's attention as he insisted on a match. The larger man was clearly annoyed, demanding to know who the young man was and telling him to get lost. The challenger persisted, making it clear that he didn't want to fight, just spar. He Taunted the larger man, implying that he was scared of revealing his skills.

 Sue Ho watched the scene unfold with mild amusement. It was always interesting to the dynamics between hunters. Sometimes a little confrontation was all it took to reveal a person's true character.

 The larger man clearly agitate and muttered under his breath, calling the challenger a nuisance and telling him to get lost. He added that he had no interest in picking a fight with a weakling.

 The young man, refusing to back down, took a step forward, suggesting that he might just attack first.

 With tension rising, the young man lunged aggressively at the larger candidate, forcing the big man to respond. The clash was abrupt with the young man's sword swinging powerfully toward his opponent.

 But before the blow could connect, Sue Ho suddenly stepped in, blocking the sword with his own.

 The larger man looked at Su Ho in surprise, questioning Su Ho had lost his mind.

 Sue Ho remained calm, assuring the man that he would handle the challenger, and that there was no need for things to escalate further. The challenger, clearly agitated, demanded to know who Sue Ho was. Sue Ho explained that he was just another test taker and nothing good would come from getting involved in a brawl. He urged the big man to leave it to him to handle this situation. The larger man huffed in frustration before turning away, muttering that he didn't care either way.

 Young man, however, wasn't satisfied. He asked Sue her why he was interfering. His irritation evident.

 Sue Ho smiled, introducing himself as en Sue Ho and remarked that it seemed like the young man was looking for a sparring partner. He offered to be that partner instead.

 The young man sneered, dismissing Sue Ho as weak and stating that he had no interest in sparring with someone like him.

 Sue Ho's eyes widened slightly at the insult. Weak. He couldn't help but feel a bit taken aback. The young man, now more confident, mocked Sue Ho, further suggesting that his earlier block had just been a stroke of luck and warning him not get cocky.

 Sue Ho looked thoughtful for a moment before tilting his head and asking if the young man was scared.

 The young man's expression twisted with anger and he demanded to know what Sue Ho had just said.

 Sue Ho repeated himself calmly, suggesting that it seemed like the young man was too scared to spar with him. The provocation worked, and the young man, now furious, declared that he was ready to teach Sue Ho a lesson.

 He had been bored anyway, surrounded by nothing but cowards and ho had just made himself the perfect target to be a punching bag.

 Sue Ho smiled, noting that the young man had accepted his challenge. Around them, people began to murmur, suggesting that they should head to the sparring arena and get the supervisors approval for an official match.

 The group moved to a spacious, empty arena, bright and open, with spectators casually gathering in the stands to watch.

 Some of the onlookers shook their heads. Commenting on how unnecessary it was to cause a scene. Such an important day, others dismissed the participants as attention seekers

 and officials stepped forward. Addressing Sue Ho and the young man as prepared for the sparring match, the official explained that only training weapons provided by the association would be allowed and that he would stop the match if things got out of hand.

 He then gave a signal with a quick movement of his hand, declaring the start of the sparring match.

 The two competitors faced each other, each wielding a wooden sword.

 The atmosphere grew tense as they engaged in a rapid exchange, their movements precise and powerful. Sue Ho's opponent swung aggressively, aiming to overpower him with brute force. Sue Ho, however, moved with practiced ease, blocking each strike and watching his opponent carefully.

 The young man clearly frustrated, shouted that he would tear Sue Ho apart. He lunged forward,

 but Su Ho blocked the attack effortlessly.

 Sue Ho looked at him with a mix of surprise and disappointment, asking why he was so weak.

 His expression, turning disdainful, remarked that his opponent was completely weak, hardly worth the effort.

 The young man, now furious beyond reason, shouted insults at Sue Ho, his rage palpable. Looking at the person in front of him, Sue Ho felt the tense atmosphere hanging in the air. He recalled who this person really was.

 His name is Pak Yong, the skilled swordsman who emanated a fierce energy as a red mist swirled around him,

 a man whose eyes gleamed with an insatiable thirst for power, the same thirst that had driven him to fight the strongest opponents he could find. Always craving greater mastery over his swordsmanship.

 Over time, his pursuit of strength had taken a darker turn,

 transforming him into a feared hunter killer. Relentless his quest for dominance.

 Sue Ho stood on the sidelines, his eyes narrowing as he recognized Pak Yong memories from his past. Life flickered through his mind. Pak Yong had been formidable back then, but tragically misguided. Sue Ho knew he had to prevent Pak Yong from making the same mistakes again. He reflected on Pak Yong's potential. Feeling a sense of obligation to intervene before the swordsman lost himself in the darkness once more.

 He smirked as memories of his past life flashed before his eyes. He remembered Pak Yong strength well, having faced him before, the swordsman had been formidable back then. But Su Ho now, the raw, unrefined nature of his skills. He sighed, thinking that it was surprising to see Pak Yong in this test area. His skills had been impressive before, but he still lacked experience and the refined precision needed to master his skills.

 He moved swiftly, his foot landing on Pak Yong's chest, sending him flying backward across the arena.

 Pak Yong's fall was dramatic. His body crashing to the ground with a thud.

 Sue Ho remained where he stood, his face showing nothing but boredom. He found the situation dull. Mocking his enemy as Pak Young had been talking so confidently earlier that he expected more from him.

 Pak Young struggled to his feet, his eyes wide with disbelief and pain. He looked at Sue Ho, clearly bewildered by the immense strength his opponent had shown. He

 demanded to know how Su Ho possessed such strength. His voice tinged with frustration. Sue Ho merely shrugged, suggesting nonchalantly that rushing at him wouldn't work and questioning if Pak Yong really wanted to continue. Sue Ho observed Pak Yong stance, concluding that this must be Pak Yang's first time facing a Level ten opponent as the strongest he had likely fought before was a Level five.

 Despite the setback, Pak Yong wasn't disheartened. A smirk tugged at his lips as he found something interesting and Sue Ho, something he hadn't encountered in a long time.

 He remarked that he now understood why Su Ho had been so relaxed. The atmosphere shifted and the tension thickened as Pak Yong prepared himself for another round.

 He clenched his sword, his eyes gleaming with renewed determination, and declared that he would go all out. Ho watched as Pak Yong gathered his energy. A red aura swirling around him.

 He couldn't help but smile as if humoring a child.

 Pak Yong launched himself, Atsuko, his sword slicing through the air with fierce intensity.

 The two collided in a flurry of rapid movements, the clash of their weapons, echoing throughout the arena.

 Each swing carried the weight of their power, and for a brief moment, Pak Yong seemed to push Sue Ho back. Their energies colliding like waves crashing against a rock.

 Sue Ho felt the weight behind Pak Yong strikes, acknowledging that it was definitely heavier than before.

 Pak young panting sneered at Su Ho, asking if he would continue to act relaxed. Frustration was evident in his voice.

 He increased his power, his fiery red aura intensifying as he prepared for a decisive blow.

 He roared, challenging Su Ho to see if he could stop his next attack. He took up a stance that made Su Ho's eyes widened slightly in recognition. Su Ho realized that Pak Yong was using his original technique, the Dragon sword technique, with a powerful shout Pak, Yong launched his attack. His sword aimed straight for Su ho.

 A massive explosion erupted as the two forces met blinding light, filling the scene.

 Pak Yong felt the impact and believed he had finally succeeded, murmuring to himself that he had won.

 However, as the light faded, Su ho stood firm, his sword held firmly as he blocked Pak Yong's attack.

 He let out a small sigh and grinned confidently. Meeting Pak Yong shocked gaze. He pointed out that he had blocked the attack with ease. He could even do it with closed eyes,

 Pak Yong stammered, his eyes wide with disbelief as he tried to comprehend how Sumo had managed to stop him.

 Sumo's thoughts raced as he analyzed the attack, realizing it wasn't truly the Dragon Sword technique yet, but just a basic sword technique.

 Pak Yong, wounded in his pride, let out a furious shout, calling Su Ho a bastard.

 The fight continued with Pak Yong attacking with relentless force. He swung with all his might, the red energy surrounding him growing brighter with each strike.

 Sumo was pushed back momentarily, but he remained composed. Waiting for an opening.

 When Pak Yong saw Su Ho being pushed back, he believed he had an opportunity.

 He lunged forward, pouring all his energy into his strike.

 Sumo, however, blocked it effortlessly, and before Pak Yong could react, Su Ho's fist punched his jaw, sending him reeling backward.

 Pak Yong stumbled, his vision blurring from the impact. He muttered in disbelief. Struggling to stay on his feet, wondering how Sumo had managed it

 to ho shook his head. Calmly stating that Pak Yong's attacks were too slow without

 another word. He watched as Pak Yong was thrown across the arena, his body hitting the ground hard.

 He took a deep breath and decided it was time to end things. He thought to himself that if he damaged Pak Yong's confidence any further, it could cause real trouble.

 The arena fell silent and the spectators watched in awe. Sue Ho stood there, his presence commanding

 while Pak Yong lay on the ground, losing consciousness. He

 considered that there was a lesson to be learned here, both for Pak Yong and for himself. The past was a place of regrets, but the present was where they could change their fate. He watched over the defeated Pak Young, contemplating what had just transpired. He thought to himself that now that Pak Yong was fixated on him, the young swordsman wouldn't pay attention to anyone else until he managed to defeat him. Well, of course, that dream won't be happening. Su Ho couldn't help but think that the testing center would become much quieter now.

 He called out for the supervisor, who looked so shocked right now. When the supervisor finally responded, his voice carried a hint of nervousness. Clearly unsettled by the big fight before

 Su Ho explained almost casually that he had accidentally knocked Pak Yong out and requested the supervisor to take care of him until he regained consciousness. The supervisor nodded, acknowledge judging the request with understanding and assured Su Ho that he would handle it.

 The scene then shifted to the test area. Numerous technicians were bustling around and several capsules could be seen in the high tech lab.

 Su Ho observed the area carefully, noting that there seemed to be more skilled managers now than before. He suspected they were likely buffed doping inspectors disguised as technicians. Scrutinizing the candidates closely,

 Su ho stood by a capsule, watching as the technicians worked. He overheard a conversation nearby with someone complaining about not being compatible with the capsule and being directed elsewhere for. Testing. A technician tried to calm the person down, urging them to follow along for now.

 Eventually, it was Sue Ho's turn. He was instructed to lie down in one of the capsules. He nodded, complying without hesitation.

 The technician overseeing him explained that if he felt any strange sensations during the dive process, he should press the button to request emergency assistance. Sue Ho acknowledged the instructions, indicating his understanding.

 The technician initiated the dive and the high tech interface lit up,

 showing the progress as the system connected to Sue Ho's consciousness. A system voice announced that the Hunter Practical Test program was now activated and the dive progress began.

 The connection was completed and the healer practical test scenario started.

 As the scene shifted, Sue Ho found standing in the middle of a reddish cityscape. The environment was desolate, with crumbling buildings and debris scattered everywhere. He remarked that this particular exam was known for its difficulty, especially considering the low pass rate for healers.

 His thoughts interrupted by the sight of a young girl crying while kneeling on the ground. She appeared to be injured and Sue Ho approached cautiously.

 The devastated urban area seemed almost lifelike, with screams echoing in the distance, adding to the tension of the scene.

 Sue Ho observed the destruction with disbelief. Unable to fathom how the association had set up such an intense scenario, he muttered to himself that the great Hunter Association seemed to have no sense of moderate.

 The whole test felt like it was designed to be traumatizing, and Sue Ho couldn't help but feel a wave of fatigue and frustration wash over him.

 He sighed, heavily, clenching his fist as he considered the situation. He knew that this was why healers were so highly valued. They were always in the most chaotic and dangerous, expected to provide support despite the overwhelming odds. Sue Ho understood the importance of his role, but it didn't make the task any less daunting. The practical test was considered the core of the Hunter exam. It was the real deal where every aspiring hunter's ability to fit into their chosen class was thoroughly tested.

 For Warriors, Mages and Archers. It was all about combat prowess. Their simulation scenarios shifted every year and passing criteria varied accordingly.

 One on one, battles one versus many how long they survived and how many enemies they defeated played a large role in their final score.

 However, for healers, the practical test was different.

 Their path was not about defeating enemies or overpowering adversaries. Instead, it revolved around the virtue of sacrifice

 to the examiners A healer who could heal well was important, but one who could risk their life to save others was even more valuable. The test was about more than magical power or skill. It was about putting others before oneself, no matter the cost. The higher scores went to those who put their safety on the line to protect others.

 Sumo readied for the task standing before the simulation set up. He pondered the absurdity of the challenge. Healers in this test often needed to die while protecting their assigned. The system had brought him back to life once already. The thought of dying again for a test made Su ho sigh deeply.

 He looked at the sword, stuck in the ground

 and walked toward it with a determined stride.

 He smiled faintly, holding the sword firmly as he considered how absurd it was to be expected to die willingly. He understood the test expected sacrifice, but if it came to it, Su Ho intended to bend the rules in his favor. After he wasn't just any healer.

 Suddenly, desperate cries echoed around him. Sumo glanced around, listening to the screams filled the air. Yet as he looked, all he saw were bodies dead, unmoving. The entire simulation area was littered with fallen figures, their faces frozen in their final moments of terror. It was as if he were on a battlefield where all hope had been lost and only one survivor remained.

 He approached the girl he saw kneeling beside her.

 Her eyes were still open, filled with fear and uncertainty. Sumo asked if she was okay. Examining her injuries,

 she struggled to speak. Her voice trembling as she warned him that they would be back and that they needed to run away before they returned.

 Sue. Host shook his head and reassured her that rescue teams would arrive soon. He promised to keep her safe until then. He knew what he had to do protect her until the very end.

 Meanwhile, in the real world, the exam facility was bustling with activity. Pods lined the room, each one occupied by a test taker undergoing their own simulation. Their minds immersed in the virtual challenges.

 One of the test takers stepped out of his pod. His expression? Tired and disappointed, muttering to himself that he could have done more as he rubbed his neck. A staff member, a woman in a neat uniform, gave him an encouraging smile and thanked him for his hard work, instructing him to gather his personal belongings and head home.

 The man nodded slowly, still deep in thought as he walked away

 on a nearby screen. His results were displayed. Kang Jin. Young Class Archer. Time. 9 minutes. 4 seconds.

 His time wasn't particularly high, and as the woman looked over the scores, she sighed. The woman remarked that maybe the difficulty was high as the season scores seemed particularly low.

 Then she asked another staff member how long the examinee inside his watched pod. Su ho had been in the simulation. The other staff director, Shin, looked up from his own screen and replied that it seemed like Su Ho had been in there for quite a while.

 The woman looked surprised, noting that it had been 30 minutes, which was far longer than the usual 15 minute mark.

 She leaned closer to the screen in the pod, confirming the time.

 30 minutes and 21 seconds. She let out an exclamation of disbelief. It peaked her interest, making her wonder just what kind of person was behind this score.

 Director Shin and the woman were observing the real time feed from Su Ho simulation. They watched as Su Ho wielded a sword fighting off creatures while keeping his patient safe.

 The woman was incredulous, commenting on how good a fighter he and asking if he was a warrior. Director Shin clarified that Sumo was actually a healer. The woman scoffed, suggesting that director was lying. Pointing out that Su Ho was holding a sword.

 Yet he gestured toward the screen, asking her to take a closer look. On the screen, Su ho was indeed fighting with a sword. His movements fluid and powerful. But it wasn't just about the swordplay. The woman watched closely as Su Ho used healing in between attacks, his focus constantly shifting back to the injured woman he was protecting. He healed her injuries, kept her shielded and fought off the approaching monsters with skill and precision.

 The woman expressed her disbelief, noting how amazing it was that a healer could fight like this. She wondered aloud if Sumo be disqualified for not getting beaten to death, given how it usually demanded sacrifice. Director Shin explained that there was actually no reason for disqualification. He pointed that the Healers main goal was to protect the patient until the end, and Su Ho was doing just that while fulfilling all the requirements

 the screen showed Su Ho fending off monsters, always staying close to his patient, never abandoning her. He kept healing her whenever she needed it. His focus unwavering.

 Director Shin emphasized that Sumo was properly escorting and staying close to the patient, healing her when needed and risking his life to protect her.

 Since all conditions were met, there was no reason to disqualify him. Even the practical program system didn't intervene.

 The woman nodded, slowly, smiling as she realized that the top student in this practical exam had likely been decided.

 Back in the simulation, Su Ho stood in the darkened landscape, gripping his sword tightly.

 Several small green lizard creatures approached him, their movements aggressive and hostile. Sumo eyed them calmly, unsheathed his sword in a smooth motion

 as creatures lunged,

 he swung the sword with great precision, striking them all with one hit.

 He muttered to himself that it wasn't enough. Deciding he needed to be a little faster,

 he sped up his movements, his body flowing seamlessly as he evaded and attacked. The creature swarmed. But Sumo was ready.

 His weapon slicing through them with determination and skill,

 a system notification suddenly appeared before him. The system acknowledged that his level of understanding the skillful play was very high and congratulated him for mastering foot play.

 Sumo smiled, feeling satisfaction. He reflected that expected even if this place was virtual reality. If they were on earth, no one could escape the surveillance of the system. He understood how the system worked. It detected his physical movements, acknowledged his mastery, and allowed him to progress even within this simulated environment. He noted that although the experience gain rate was lower compared to physically overworking the body, it was still perfect for skill training.

 In addition to swordsmanship, he also gained various skills. He upgraded all the sword skills he had acquired to a rank. It might not give experience, points or items, but it was satisfying enough.

 Another notification appeared glowing softly, congratulating him for upgrading his horizontal slash skill to rank a

 sumo envisioned a grid of skills. Considering their potential growth, he mused that if he could acquire all the basic skills related to swordsmanship and raise them all to a rank or higher, he could obtain a technique like Pak Yong's Dragon Sword technique.

 Suddenly, the system notification glowed brightly, unlike any other notification he had seen before. It almost resembled a portal glowing with intense energy light surrounded sumo, signifying a major achievement.

 The system informed him that his understanding of swordsmanship was higher than anyone else's, and that it was impressed by his unique swordsmanship. The system offered to fully acknowledge it and asked if he wanted to register a new swordsmanship skill integrating basic sword techniques and basic foot play. Upon registration, a new rank would be assigned and he could name it himself.

 A satisfied expression appeared on Su Ho's face. This was it. What he had been waiting for. He raised his head. His eyes shining with the determination. Welcome back. My sword. My guardian sword.

 Su hosted before the glowing digital screen, his eyes reflecting the brightness of the announcement. The system's message hung in the air, offering him a unique opportunity. It asked if Guardian Sword was the correct name for the new skill he had created. Su Ho nodded slightly, a smirk, playing on his lips, confirming that it was.

 The system responded immediately, congratulating him on the supreme mastery of his skill.

 The screen brightened as energy swirled around sumo, enveloping him in a shimmering display of light and power. A new skill had been born and it bore his mark. Guardian sword rank s

 su ho's expression remained confident, almost proud, as he observed the digital interface. It listed the additional benefits that came with his achievement. His existing swordsmanship and footwork skills were now increased by 50%. Then came another unexpected surprise.

 The system had granted him sword mastery, which is also rank. S Sword mastery was something special, a privilege reserved only for those with an exceptional understanding of the blade. It removed any limitations on learning or using swordsmanship skills. It lifted the restrictions on all swords and increased the effectiveness of his techniques by an additional 50%.

 Sumo reflected on this development, gripping his sword with pride in his past life. It had taken him over ten years to obtain this power, but now, knowing what he knew, it all came so much faster. His value had increased and he couldn't help but think that things were about to get much more interesting.

 Suddenly, his senses snapped back to the present. Near him, a group of fearsome monsters advanced their sharp teeth glistened drool dripping from their gaping mouths as they moved closer. Threateningly

 sumo eyed them with a cool demeanor, noticing their sheer numbers. He knew the number of monsters for this test was fixed. He had already obtained everything he wanted and he was ready to leave. But there was only one way out. He gripped his sword firmly. Determination etched across his face. There were two options to finish this test. Either fall at the hands of these monsters or find another way

 to Zuko. The answer was clear. A grin spread across his face as he looked at the approaching, deciding that he would kill them all.

 Meanwhile, outside in the testing area, a group of people had gathered around a display screen linked to Soho's pod.

 The screen flashed a new message, catching everyone's attention. All the monsters prepared for the practical test had been eliminated. Please restart the program.

 There was a moment of stunned silence, Then murmurs spread among the spectators. One person expressed disbelief at what had happened. Another nodded, astonished, acknowledging that this was the first time in the history of practical tests that something like this had occurred. Someone else voiced admiration,

 commenting on how impressive it was that Sumo had even healed the patient. One of the examiners sighed, remarking that there was no point in looking at the rankings for this exam.

 A few days later at Hexagon Guild headquarters, a different scene was unfolding

 inside the headquarters. A group of people sat in a meeting room. Confidence exuding from expressions. One of them guaranteed that candidate would be the top student this year.

 Someone else agreed, enthusiastically mentioning the effort put into raising key human, which the candidate and asserting that this time it was hexagon, not prime that would take the top spot.

 Suddenly a projector screen turned on, displaying a congratulate teary message from the South Korean Hunter Association. The announcement revealed the top candidates with Su Ho's name standing proudly at the top of the list. Below it, other names followed, but none belonged to Kun.

 Confusion spread through the room as someone exclaimed in disbelief. Asking Who on Su Ho was. Another person murmured in panic, wondering where Kun was.

 One of them holding a phone, stared at the screen as a call came in. The name of the guild master. Flashed on the screen and they panicked that the Guild master was calling

 elsewhere in a car. Su Ho's phone buzzed and Tillman's voice came through. Filled with warmth.

 He apologized for not congratulating Su Ho right after the announcement, explaining that he been busy. Su hosted smile widened as he listened, feeling genuine appreciation.

 He thanked Shulman, attributing his success to him.

 Tillman chuckled, filled with admiration, and pointed out that Su Ho had not only passed but had done so with the top score. He added that thanks to SU how they had been able to catch many cheaters involved in skill doping and that this would lead to strengthened testing regulations in the future. Sue Ho nodded, expressing his agreement that tests should be fair.

 Tillman then hesitated for a moment, sounding thoughtful and asked Sue Ho if he was still interested in joining the Korean Hunter Association. When Sue

 Ho's expression grew firm, as he replied that while he might stay in the Guild for a while. His intentions were unwavering. He would join the great Hunter Association no matter what. Tillman thanked him, his relief evident, and promised to contact Sue Ho as soon as the test schedule or recruitment was announced.

 Sue Ho agreed. Then mentioned that it was lunchtime and asked Tillman to make sure to eat well even if he was busy.

 Tillman laughed warmly, wishing Su Ho the same

 as the call ended, Sue Ho held his phone for a moment. His expression growing concerned as he wondered aloud if Tillman was okay, noting that his voice had sounded a little hoarse. He then shifted his thoughts, anticipating another call soon.

 Just then, his phone screen lit up with an incoming call. Sue Ho's eyes sharpened, and he prepared to answer, remarking to himself that it was as expected before picking up the call.

 Director Kim Sue I and congratulated Ho on his success, informing him that the payment had been made as per the contract. She then asked about Sue Ho joining the Nexus Guild, promising him better treatment than any other guild.

 Sue Ho's response was polite but measured, asking how far she could go with this offer.

 Director Kim's voice remained enthusiastic as she assured him that she would do her best to meet his expectations. She mentioned that as an Academy scholarship student who had graduated at the top, adjusting the terms would be easy. She then suggested meeting in person to discuss it further.

 Sue Ho thanked her for the offer, but explained that he had personal plans for the day. He promised to check his schedule and get back to her. Adding that as a Nexus scholarship student, it would look better for him to join Nexus rather than another Guild

 director. Kim's excitement was palpable even over the phone as she agreed, urging him not to sign a contract with anyone else during this time and promising to accommodate his schedule.

 Sue Ho chuckled lightly and assured her that he would see her soon as he hung up. Sue Ho couldn't help but smile, commenting to himself that she was really excited and that he could still hear her enthusiasm.

 The taxi slowed to a stop and the driver informed Sue Ho they had arrived. Sue Ho nodded, thanking the driver.

 He stepped out of the car, looking ahead at the old market before him. Determination. Clear in his eyes. He reflected on having passed the test, received his license and obtained the deposit. The street was bustling with people all about their daily routines. Sue Ho took a deep breath, his gaze resolute as he thought about what was left to do.

 It was time for farming in this place. Lighthouse General Market.

 Some time passed and he reminded himself that he had bought everything he needed for his new life as a hunter.

 Now, all that remained was to find a weapon.

 His steps carried him into a small, slightly rundown shop filled with a variety of weapons.

 Sue Ho approached the counter where shopkeeper stood. Sue Ho greeted the shopkeeper. His eyes already scanning the collection. The shopkeeper looked at him curiously, asking what he was looking for.

 Suha, with a polite smile, explained that he had just become a hunter and was looking for a lightweight weapon that he could use. He knew this was going to be a challenge. Finding something good, a lot of money. He had to be careful. The shopkeeper, considered for a moment, then pointed at a section in the back, mentioning that the items over there were a bit cheaper.

 Sue Ho nodded, gratefully, thanking him and walking towards the shelves, which looked like they hadn't been touched in ages. Dust coated most of the weapons, making them seem forgotten.

 He ran his fingers over a particularly dusty blade and couldn't help but think inwardly. Amused by the sight about how much dust there was, he carefully examined each weapon, noting how many low grade weapons lacked verified information. It was as if their true value had yet to be uncovered.

 But Su ho knew that even unverified weapons could have hidden potential.

 Holding a spear with cautious hands. He remarked to himself that there were cases where weapons needed to go through a process of liberation to born as true weapons. Such weapons usually emitted an aura that asked for recognition. He believed not many players would recognize such a weapon in a place like this.

 He could sense something unique about the spear in his grasp. Slowly, he closed his eyes and concentrated. A notification appeared, and he felt the subtle tingle of energy. The system announced that magic detection had been activated.

 Sue Ho smiled faintly, sensing the swirling blue energy around the spear. He thought with satisfaction that he had found it. The setting shifted. Now Sue Ho stood alone in a sunny park surrounded by green trees.

 The spear rested in his hand and he stared at it with a mix of confidence and anticipation. If the shopkeeper knew what he had just sold, he would certainly regret it someday. Sue Ho could imagine the man lamenting over his decision to let the spear go for so cheap.

 But that was a thought for another day. Right now, Sue Ho has work to do. Lightly gripping the spear, he told himself it was time to begin. He took a deep breath and the calm, peaceful atmosphere suddenly grew tense.

 The energy around him began to gather. Drawn to the spear, creating a powerful aura that surrounded both the spear and sumo.

 The system's voice echoed in his mind, informing him that magical power was being supplied.

 The consciousness of the weapon began to awaken and Sumo could feel it. The surge of energy took him by surprise, causing his eyes to widen. He grunted in pain as he felt the pressure.

 The spear was alive. Energy pulsating, drawing more and more of Soho's magic power.

 He struggled to maintain his grip, realizing in alarm that it was absorbing far more energy than he had anticipated.

 Sue Ho thought about how the spear was rapidly absorbing his magic power. Panic setting in as he felt his strength draining the power of the spear dramatically almost overwhelming him.

 Desperately, Su Ho released his grip, the spear clattering to the ground as he collapsed, breathless and exhausted.

 He thought that if he had been just a bit late, he would have fainted from losing all his magic power. His gaze fell on the spear. Now resting, innocuously on the ground, its energy dormant once again. He sat up, contemplating what he had just experienced.

 He mused that to wake this thing up, his magic stat needed to be at least 100. He let out a small sigh. Already planning his next move even if he couldn't use the spear right now, it would be of great help in the future. He smiled slightly. Determination in his eyes as he promised silently to level up quickly and wake the spear.

 Elsewhere, a bright sky shone over a tall building with a prominent sign reading PBS

 inside. Jo Jin Hui sat at a cluttered desk focused on his laptop. The mundane routine was interrupted by the sudden ringing of his phone. Jin Hui answered the phone, sounding only mildly curious.

 The voice on the other end spoke with a sense of familiarity, identifying himself as en su ho and confirming that Jin Hui was the reporter from PBS. As Jin

 Hui blinked in surprise. He paused, trying to remember the name. He questioned who Su Ho was. Repeating the name to himself.

 Suddenly realization struck him. He was speaking to top candidate Ansu Ho Sue. Ho confirmed calmly that he was indeed on Su Ho, adding that he was also the solo rater of the unprecedented gait that had recently occurred at Sindrome Station.

 Jin Hui's eyes widened in shock as he realized Sue Ho was talking about the syndrome incident. He leaned back in his chair, trying to comprehend what he had just heard. His thoughts raced as he considered the possibility that Su Ho had cleared the unprecedented gate even before obtaining his hunter license. Marveling at what a total monster Sue Ho must be.

 Clearing his throat, Jin Hui asked Sue Ho had specifically contacted him. Sue Ho explained confidently that he had come across Jin Hui's blog while searching. He mentioned that Jin Hui was known as a golden spoon kid, but it seemed that despite that, he chose to work as a journalist, which suggested that he had a strong sense of professional pride.

 Sue Ho then told him that he had a lot of things he wanted to do moving forward and that there would be plenty of newsworthy material. He suggested that Jinhua become his exclusive reporter, though Jin, who is skeptical, expression was clear even over the phone. Jin we asked dryly if Sue Ho wanted to keep a rich reporter as his subordinate.

 He thought swirled. He assessed the man on the other end of the line. Considering that Sue Ho was just some odd guy who thought he was something special, he replied that while he understood what ho was saying, he found this type of approach a bit unpleasant, even though he was a reporter who was thirsty for scoops. He had no intention of becoming anyone's subordinate. He emphasized that what he wanted was a great partner. He clarified that the reason he was mentioning this was because it seemed like Su Ho was trying to pull a trick to boost his worth. Before joining a guild, Sue Ho let out a short laugh and admitted that Jin Hui wasn't entirely wrong. He explained that it wasn't about raising his worth, but rather about trying to gain some fame. He added that he was thinking of becoming a civil servant.

 Jin Hui paused his fingers freezing over his keyboard and asked if Sue Ho was talking about the Korean Hunter Association. He expressed his confusion, pointing out that gaining through publicity seemed more suited for someone wanting to join a large guild not to become a public servant hunter. He wondered if Sue Ho was joking su. Ho assured him that he was not joking and stated with resolve that he intended to join the Hunter Association and work in the field.

 Jin, who is skeptical ism, only grew. He asked if Sue Ho was one of those people with well-off parents who treated work like a hobby and pursued prestige. Sue host tone shifted. Becoming more serious, he revealed that he was what people called a gate orphan, and that was why he was interested in public service. Conquering gates, he said, was his life's ultimate goal.

 Jin Hui blinked, his thoughts muddled with surprise. He wondered if Sue Ho was being serious, thinking to that there were so many weirdos these days that it was hard to keep track.

 After a moment Jin Hui side and acknowledged that it didn't really matter. He understood Su Ho's point, but explained that he would still declined the offer to be an exclusive reporter. He emphasized that he would write the articles he wanted to write.

 Sue Ho responded quickly, suggesting that they make a bet. Sue Ho explained that he felt he needed to earn Jin Hui trust to win his partnership since he was a hunter. He proposed proving himself his skills.

 He added that he was planning on conquering the Tower of Challenge alone. That very day,

 Jin Hui couldn't hide his shock. He asked if Sue ho really intended to clear the Tower of Challenge, which was considered impossible to clear, even with a party all by himself.

 Sue Ho's confidence remained unshaken as he confirmed his. He assured Jin Hui that this would be enough to win his trust, and asked that if he succeeded, Jo would agree to become his exclusive and personal reporter.

 Jin Hui stared at phone, caught between disbelief and curiosity. Sue Ho was certainly an odd person, but there was something about his determination that was hard to ignore. Jin Hui stared at his phone, caught between disbelief and curiosity on Sue. Ho was certainly an odd character, but there was something about his determination that was hard to ignore.

 Sue Ho thought to himself about Jin Hui, recalling his reputation as a top broadcaster and a PBS reporter. He knew Jin Hui's pride was high and that his family had a lot of money.

 He was famous as a reporter who never accepted requests, and Sue Ho remembered how in his previous life he had collaborated many times with him due to his excellent reporting skills and his extraordinary ability to manipulate public opinion.

 However, Jin Hui's overwhelming talent eventually led to his being cast out, disappearing from the scene in any group. A sharp thorn was often seen as a threat, and Jin Hui was that thorn He had been unintentionally drawn into factional conflicts which ultimately pushed him into early retirement.

 Sue Ho was determined not to let Jinhua disappear like that again if he succeeded in conquering the Tower of Challenge alone, he should become his exclusive and personal reporter. Jin Hui appeared shocked, but Sue Ho could tell he was considering the request. He emphasized that having a close reporter would be beneficial.

 After a moment Jin Hui side and reluctantly agreed, saying that if Sue Ho managed to conquer the Tower of Challenge, he would do everything he could as a reporter to help him.

 Sue Ho smiled confidently, standing in front of the tower. He told Jin Hui that they would see each other later, ending the call while looking optimistic with determination. Sue Ho decided that it was time to get started

 in the office. Jin Hui sat alone, feeling frustrated. He muttered to himself about how annoying Sue Ho was and how the man was really driving him crazy.

 Sitting at his office desk, he pondered over Sue intentions, questioning why Sue Ho had suddenly made such an outrageous proposition.

 Despite the annoyance, he found that it didn't feel entirely bad. He stared at his phone, the reflective screen mirroring his expression, he contemplated the sincerity in Sue Ho's words.

 It didn't sound like a lie, and he didn't believe Sue Ho was a scammer. He leaned back in his chair, his thoughts swirling, feeling on the verge of losing his mind. He let out an exasperated sigh, acknowledging to himself that this whole situation was making him go crazy.

 Jin Hui finally sat up, appearing, resigned. He told himself that whatever happened, it didn't matter if Sue Ho's claims were true, then that was great. If not, so be it. It was a gamble with no real downside.

 Determined he stood up and walked towards the door. He decided that he would see where this gamble led.

 Meanwhile, at the Tower of Challenge, the area was bustling with people approaching the tower eager to take on its challenges.

 Sue Ho stood before the tower, speaking to someone as he observed the scene. He asked if he could enter now, showing his ID card to the guard.

 The guard confirmed that Sue Ho could enter, but asked if he was alone. Sue Ho nodded, explaining that he intended to attempt it solo. The guard looked hesitant, mentioning that while it wasn't impossible, it was unusual for someone who had just passed the Hunter exam Go alone.

 He suggested that it might be better to form a party as even the lower levels of the tower could be dangerous.

 Sue Ho simply smiled, assuring the guard that he was fine and preferred being alone.

 The guard, though worried, ultimately allowed him to proceed. He informed Sue Ho of the entry fee and requested payment. Once Sue Ho received the invoice,

 Sue Ho nodded, thanking the guard and assuring him that he would be careful.

 He acknowledged the guards warning to return immediately if things seemed impossible.

 As Sue Ho entered, he thought of the Tower of Challenge, which was commonly known as the hunting Ground. It was a public gate managed by the country, designed to allow players below level 20 to freely challenge themselves for self-development. He was ready to face whatever awaited him inside.

 He placed his hands against the door, feeling determined. He reminded himself that now that his level had been reset, there was no better hunting ground than this

 with a resolute push. He opened the large door, revealing a bright light inside. The atmosphere grew intense, filled with anticipation.

 The system informed him that he had entered the Tower of Challenge. The system reassured that he could forfeit at any time.

 The moment he declared his withdrawal, he would be forcibly transported back to the entrance.

 With that in mind, Sue Ho prepared himself for what was to come as he summoned his sword.

 The system's voice rang out again, announcing that the first floor challenge had begun.

 A large green slime monster emerged and Sue Ho let out a big sigh. He quickly readied himself to face approaching slime, gripping his sword tightly. He noted that it was the first floor monster, a slime, the site of its size and speed, took him aback when he first time entered the tower. But now he can quickly assess the situation. While the slime damage was practically non-existent at level one, he knew that if he got caught up in its antics, it could become problematic. He needed to take care of it swiftly before it caused any trouble

 charging at the slime with determination. Sue Ho planned next move carefully.

 He knew he could easily subdue it by destroying the core

 with a decisive strike. Sue Ho destroyed the slime core landing on the ground with confidence.

 However, he knew the fight wasn't over.

 From the remains of the defeated slime, a group of smaller slime emerged. Sue Ho observed them calmly, noting how annoying it was that the split core could regenerate into multiple entities, although they were weaker due to being divided and there were limits to their regeneration. This characteristic was the reason why party play was recommended in the Tower of Challenge

 without hesitation. Sue Ho rushed forward, ready to confront the creatures. He reminded himself that monsters would come out in groups on almost every floor. And this was just the beginning.

 Dodging and swinging his weapon with precision, Sue Ho created a powerful arc of energy, slicing through the slime with skill.

 He leaped into the air and struck down on the monster's aiming for a decisive blow each time.

 He skillfully swung his sword, narrowly avoiding a strike from one of the creatures tentacles. His agility and determination kept his focus sharp, allowing him to dodge their attacks. Look for opportunities.

 The creatures attacked again, their massive tentacles lashing toward him

 with a swift maneuver. Sue Ho evaded creating moment of opportunity. He leaped and caught one of the tentacles mid-air, holding on to it firmly. His grip was tight, his resolve unyielding, as he used the leverage against the beast.

 He hung in the air with a calm expression, showing no fear. Despite the circumstances, he remained calm and composed, facing his adversary, undeterred by its power with a confident smile, Sue Ho thanked the creature, saying that he just needed something to hold on to.

 He then expertly swung his sword, slicing through the creatures with ease.

 After dispatching the enemy's

 Sue, Ho looked up into the towering structure above him. There were still 48 floors left to conquer, and he knew there was no time to rest. With his sword held firmly in his hand, Sue Ho prepared himself for the next challenge.

 A blue system notification appeared before him, informing him that the second floor challenge had begun.

 Inside this tower of challenge. He was reflecting on the records that had been set before him

 in his past life. The highest official record for the tower was 48 floors, a feat accomplished through party play. Currently, the record was only nine floors and it too was achieved with the team.

 Sue Ho knew well how challenging the tower could be, especially alone. Without hesitation, he moved swiftly,

 engaging an undead enemy that blocked his way. The Tower of Challenge was usually faced with a party of hunters. The strength of the monsters was proportional to the number of challengers, and the experience gained was split among the party.

 It was often a wiser choice to challenge the tower in a group as it was much safer and helped ensure long term progress. But Sue Ho wasn't interested in the standard way. He was confident in his abilities and preferred to do things differently. Surrounded by fallen enemies that emitted a faint blue glow.

 Sue Ho looked upward as the digital notification appeared before him, and after a while the system informed him that he had conquered the 18th floor.

 The system prompted him with a question Do you wish to challenge the 19th floor? Without hesitation. Sue Ho accepted. He moved forward confidently. Anticipation burning in his eyes. The 19th floor was different from the previous ones. Instead of facing a multitude of enemies, there was only a single opponent. This meant one thing. The opponent would be much stronger.

 Sue Ho's feet moved swiftly as he ran energy radiating from him. The solitary monster on the 19th floor was formidable, but on the bright side, Sue Ho only needed to defeat one foe. That would be enough to clear the floor.

 Suddenly, a massive figure appeared in the distance, a giant orc, its muscular frame covered in red hair

 without wasting a moment. Sue Ho lunged forward, his sword drawn and determination fueling his every move.

 He fell upon the monster with immense force, shouting a greeting to the foe as he struck

 his weapon, glowed, slicing cleanly through the air and landing with a powerful, unavoidable impact.

 A splash of blood marked his success and the giant orc fell defeated the sudden and overwhelming strike. The system notified him of his victory. You have conquered the 19th floor.

 Another prompt followed, asking if he wished to challenge 20th floor. Sue Ho stood amidst the aftermath. He dismissed the prompt for now deciding to take a moment to gather his bearings. In a bit, he muttered his gaze, shifting to the remains of the fallen orc.

 Unlike the previous floors, there was something unique about the 19th typically monsters in tower varnished immediately upon death, leaving no trace behind. However, this particular enemy, the red gain, did not disappear right away.

 Sue Ho approached the large tusk that the creature had dropped a smile forming on his lips as he picked it up.

 He noted to himself that this was exactly what he had been looking for. Examining the tusk carefully, he knew that this item wasn't something that could be used alone. It had a specific purpose.

 Holding the tusk, Sugo activated his magic detection ability, allowing a shimmering aura to envelop his surroundings.

 The environment glowed faintly, revealing a hidden spot in the wall nearby. He murmured that he had found it. His eyes locking on to a glowing indentation in the stone.

 He approached it, placing the tusk inside the wall

 with a rumble. A portal appeared before him, swirling with cosmic energy.

 Su ho's eyes lit up with satisfaction. He realized that this must be the subspace fortress of the fortress. King Jang Pyong Ho. He knew that defeating the red gain would grant him access to this unique subspace.

 Unlike items that created limited sub spaces,

 this fortress allowed living beings to enter and exit freely. It was a rare and valuable power. Without further ado, Su host stepped through the portal,

 finding himself in a dim cave illuminated by the glow of a floating orb.

 He mused that it looked like a cave. As he approached the orb, which emitted an increasingly bright light,

 the system spoke again, informing him that the owner of the subspace fortress had died and asked if he would become the new owner of the subspace fortress.

 Soho responded without hesitation that he accepted, placing his hand on the glowing orb.

 The system congratulated him on becoming the new owner of the subspace fortress. The light in his palm intensified swirling around him as he closed his hand, feeling the newfound power resonate deeply within him.

 Soho noted that it was bound as a skill, not an item. This was a unique feature. The fortress wasn't just a place to store belongings. It was a part of him now linked to his magic power. He could sense that the subspace would evolve based on his abilities.

 Suddenly, the entire area glowed. The surroundings shifting. As the system announced,

 the subspace fortress has been reconstructed. Sumo shielded his eyes from the burst of light. And when he lowered his hand,

 he found himself standing in a lavish modern room. He acknowledged that he hadn't realized it had this feature. Looking around thoughtfully, he considered how it felt like he could simply go home right after defeating monsters, noting to himself that it was even better than he had initially thought.

 He could see that the space was tailored to his tastes and he appreciated its convenience. The system's instructions made it clear that the fortress would grow in size and utility. As his magic power increased.

 He took a moment to reflect, smiling at the thought that he had managed to prevent Zhang Pyong Ho from ever acquiring this skill.

 He remembered the trouble that smuggler had caused in his past life, using the fortress to store everything from illegal substances to stolen treasures and even kidnaped people. Now, all of that potential had been put into the right hands.

 Sumo thought to himself that by stopping the emergence of the Fortress King early on and securing his own personal fortress, it was a two for one deal. His confidence growing with his new fortress and renewed determination. He was ready for whatever lay ahead. He decided it was time to keep going up. His voice filled with resolve. The tower of Challenge awaited and sumo intended to conquer every floor

 outside the Tower of Challenge. Jin Hui stood quietly, staring at his phone, his finger scrolling through the article.

 The headline caught his attention immediately. En su ho number one in the latest awaken or test. The article praised Su Ho's incredible performance in the recent Awakening rankings, where he had outperformed even the most seasoned challengers. And of course, Nexus is also getting a lot of attention

 for some time, Jin Hui thought many students would be drawn to Nexus. The article was sure to boost their popularity even further. But he remembered Soo Ho had mentioned that he was planning to join the Korean Hunter Association. But now the article hinted that Nexus Publishing was already working to bring him on board. Nexus seemed confident that Sue Ho's future lay with them and they were positioning themselves to secure him before anyone else could. Now he wonder how manly flaw that Su ho conquered by now.

 He thought about it for a moment but a sudden notification from the system startled him. The 30th floor has been conquered. Jin Hui blinked in shock. That was fast. He wonder. Is he really here in the tower when the record is broken? This is sure going to be a hot update.

 Yet the system pop out again, stating that the highest record for the Tower of Challenge has been updated and a new challenger is taking on the 31st floor. Around him, people began to murmur, speculating about which guild might be behind this new record. Some wondered if a large guild had sent a party to conquer the floor. But Jin Hui, with a growing suspicion, narrowed his eyes. Could it be Sue Ho?

 Then the system keeps showing the 31st floor now has been conquered.

 Jin Hui's jaw tightened. Only a short while had passed since the challenge began. And now the floor was conquered. If it was Sue Ho, his progress was even faster than expected. Jin Hui had initially thought of him as someone who relied on flashy moves and luck. But now it was becoming clear Sue Ho was no ordinary awakened her.

 On top of the tower, a crystal glowing, and the system announced that the Challenger name is the player on Sue Ho and now player on Sue Ho started to challenge the 32nd floor.

 Jin Hui's hit the bottom and he stood there feeling a mix of awe and disbelief. He couldn't help but think to himself that he would be stuck with Sue Ho forever.

 Meanwhile, inside Nexus Academy Director Kim was reading the new article published with her eyes wide in shock.

 The man beside her hurriedly explained that Sue Ho was setting a new record in real time. It was difficult to believe,

 but Director Kim's mind was already racing with possibilities. She adjusted her glasses, her thoughts sharp and focused to bring someone like on Sue Ho to Nexus. They would have to offer a sum beyond their wildest dreams. The time to act was now. Without wasting a moment, she instructed her team to contact the president and office manager and head straight to headquarters. She won't let anyone catch Sue Ho because he is the one would be the ace for Nexus.

 Back to Sue Ho as he continued his ascent in the tower, his progress kept going further. The system soon notified him of his conquest of the 48th floor. Sue Ho, slightly out of breath, knelt on the floor, his sword embedded in the ground.

 He wiped the sweat from his forehead, his muscles aching from the strain, rushing the tower is indeed hard.

 The system then told him that he have accomplished a great achievement and the system would awards him five bonus stats.

 Sue Ho smiled. He then opened his status window, his gaze lingering on the numbers before him.

 He was now level 39, with the best stat he could possibly see in the status.

 He Let out a quiet chuckle. Reaching level 39 felt like a milestone, but what truly impressed him was the bonus stats. Gaining five bonus stats every time he broke a record felt almost too good to be true.

 To boost his mood, he decided to add the points to his magic. Well, awakening his spear, his priority for now. So all the way to magic is the answer. A bright light filled the air as the system updated his stats

 with a sense of renewed vigor. Sue Ho stood up. The final challenge was ahead and he is ready to face it.

 In front of him, a massive crystal appeared, glowing with an intense light. This crystal is one on top of the tower, indicating the highest point in this place.

 Thus, the challenge for the 49th floor had begun.

 And Sue Ho's heart raced as he steeled himself for what was to come.

 After that, the crystal's energy filled the arena,

 a dark, swirling mass of power formed in the center, taking shape.

 A great roar echoed across the arena, and from the shadows emerged the Tower Dragon. A level 49 boss, the owner of this tower. Its enormous wings spread wide, casting a terrifying shadow over the arena.

 Despite the overwhelming power radiating from the dragon, Sue Ho remained calm.

 Level 49, he thought, This is completely out of balance.

 The dragon, though not pure blooded, was likely a dragonborn and Su ho knew just how dangerous that could be.

 But he didn't flinch as the dragon let out another roar. Sue Ho felt his determination to solidify

 the fight ahead would not be. But he had come this far. There was no turning back now. Well, what can I do? I came here to conquer it. Sue Ho thought, gripping his sword tightly.

 The final battle began with a crash as Su Ho charged forward his resolve stronger than ever,

 he would face the dragon and take the final step in his journey to the first human to conquer this tower of challenge.

 The dragon's roar echoed through the battlefield as Su Ho attack landed, but it barely made an impact.

 The creature's thick scales absorbed the blow without a flinch.

 It thrashed violently, trying to shake off the strike, its eyes glowing with malicious fury as it glared down at Sue Ho, his prey.

 Well, Sue Ho had expected the creature to be tough. But this was something else. The sheer power of the dragon was more than he had imagined, and his weapon had done little to harm

 it. The dragon charged at Sue Ho and the power made even the ground crack.

 Sue Ho can't even believe how a big creature moves that fast. It's almost cheating. He can only evade while gripping his weapon, tightly, adjusting his stance as he prepared for what would come next.

 Despite the dragon's overwhelming size and strength, he remained determined.

 The dragon's growl rumbled through the air, a low menacing sound. It took another step forward. Its shadow looming large over Sue Ho.

 Though the creature was clearly enraged, Sue Ho didn't back down. He knew this fight was far from over.

 The dragon's eyes narrowed, glowing with a furious energy.

 Sue Ho could feel the tension in the air as the ground beneath them trembled. Cracks began to form in the earth around the creature as it gathered its power. The signs of an attack unmistakable. Sue Ho knew the creature was charging up for something devastating. Suddenly the dragon let out a deafening roar. A shockwave rippled through the battlefield, sending rocks and debris flying in all directions.

 Sue Ho reacted instantly, darting to the side to avoid the incoming rubble. His instincts kicked in as he leapt to the side narrowly avoiding a jagged rock. His movements were quick and precise, honed by years of battle. The dragon was powerful, but Sue Ho's agility allowed him to stay one step ahead

 as the dust settled. Sue crouched behind a broken wall, watching the dragon carefully.

 The creature was prowling its glowing eyes, scanning the area for any of movement. And what Sue Ho knew was he had to remain hidden.

 He kept his focus on the dragon, calculating his next move. The creature's level wasn't as high as he had feared,

 but its durability was still a major problem. The dragon scales were incredibly tough and regular attacks wouldn't be enough to penetrate them.

 Sue Ho knew. He had to find a weak spot, something he could exploit to land a decisive blow.

 As Sue Ho observed, the creature, his gaze shifted to the dragon's tail. He could hardly see a grayscale, and Sue Ho's heart skipped a beat.

 It was the reverse scale. The dragons most vulnerable point.

 The weak spot was located there, barely visible, but unmistakable. He knew that striking it would deal significant damage. But finding the right time was crucial. Crouching lower behind the broken wall, Sue Ho took a deep breath. He knew that the dragon was still searching for him, unaware of his discovery.

 The creature prowled its heavy footsteps, shaking the ground beneath

 it. Sue Ho's pulse quickened as he prepared to strike. His mind was focused entirely on the task at hand. With his weapon gripped tightly, Sue Ho took a deep breath, focusing all his attention on the target. He couldn't afford to miss. The battle had reached its turning point, and everything depended on whether or not he could strike at the right moment.

 As the dragon continued search, Sue Ho's body tensed, ready to spring into action. The time to strike was now.

 Su Ho made a rapid, agile jump from the crumbling wall, darting forward with precision. His movements were swift, calculated, and his eyes were set on his target.

 The dragon's tail loomed ahead, its scales glinting under the fading sunlight. Soho narrowed his focus, locking his eyes on the faint glowing mark that pulsed weakly at the dragon's tail. This was the weak point. The one spot that could change the tide of battle. He readied his sword, the cool metal steady in his hands, his gaze unwavering. Everything came down to this single strike.

 The moment of truth was upon him. He swung with all the strength, the blade, connecting with a powerful blow. And then pushed with all his might, trying to dislodge the reverse scale.

 The impact reverberated through the air, and the dragon's eyes widened. Shock and pain filling its gaze for a split second, it seemed as though time itself paused. The dragon frozen in realization.

 Then chaos erupted. The dragon let out a deafening roar, its pain transforming into rage. Sue Ho felt the backlash immediately thrown back by the sheer force of the dragon's movements.

 He tumbled. His grip barely holding to his weapon as the creature thrashed violently.

 The ground beneath them shook. The air filled with the raw fury of the beast.

 Sue Ho landed, roughly managing to steady himself just in time to see the dragon's eyes flare with rage. As expected, this won't end easily, Sue or thought his breathing heavy. He knew that the longer the battle continued, the more disadvantageous it became for him.

 The dragon's power was relentless, and with every moment that passed, the gap between their strengths widened too. Ho, he had to act quickly. There was no room for hesitation. Determination flared in Su ho's eyes as he gathered his resolve. His muscles ached, his body covered in a sheen of sweat. But his mind remained clear. He had to destroy the reverse scale. It was his only chance.

 Take this, he roared, driving his sword with all his might into the dragon scales. His arms strained every ounce of energy pouring into the strike.

 The blade pierced through and the dragon let out another bellowing roar. The energy swirling around its form in a violent spiral.

 The air crackled with tension as the dragon's aura intensified, a deep purple radiance spreading its body. Sue Ho knew what was coming. The Tower Dragon was not done yet.

 The dragon's roar echoed through the battlefield and Su Ho braced himself for the incoming. But what he got is a system notification

 stating The tower Dragon uses Dragon fear.

 Instantly, Sue Ho felt the intense pressure bear down on him, a suffocating force that chilled his very soul. His expression remained resolute, but a cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

 The seeped into his bones, slowing his movements, making every action feel like a monumental effort. He stumbled. His legs growing heavy as if they were by invisible chains. The weight of the fear crushed him, its power seeping into his mind. His head pounded and his vision blurred. The world around him spinning echoes of the dragon's roar seemed to distort in his ears, voices and sounds blending into a cacophony of chaos.

 Another notification appeared. You have fallen into a state of fear. Your muscles have become stiff.

 Sue Ho grit his teeth, fighting against the overwhelming sensation. He couldn't afford to fall now pure. He thought, desperately activating his skill. He could feel his energy drain as he attempted to rid himself of the fear.

 A new notification flashed before him pure activated. But it is a high level fear. It cannot be canceled. Sue Ho's heart sank. The fear was too powerful beyond his current capabilities to cleanse. The

 dragon moved its massive form, barreling forward its aura, glowing with a menacing intensity. The ground trembled beneath, its weight, each step resounding like thunder.

 Sumo steadied himself, a sense of dread washing over him as the realization hit him. The dragon was far from finished and its fury had only grown.

 The dragon's eyes glowed and Su ho knew he had to think of something fast. This was dangerous and was running out of time.

 Suddenly the dragon twisted its massive body and with a powerful whip of its tail, it smashed into the wall, trying to throw Su ho off

 Sue. Ho barely managed to hold on, but the impact sent a shockwave through his entire body. He could feel his grip slipping and the situation had reached a critical point. Both Sumo and Dragon were driven by an unyielding resolve, neither willing to give an inch.

 The next moment, Sumo was hurled through a portal. The dragon's massive movement him off its body. He was flung violently across space and with a heavy thud. He crashed onto solid ground. Pain shot through his entire body as he rolled to a stop.

 He thought to himself that he needed to hurry, forcing himself to move despite the pain. He

 quickly summoned a blue potion from his inventory, drinking it down in one swift gulp.

 He drank it with desperation as the dragon's roar echoed from the other side of the portal.

 Immediately, a calming energy flooded through his veins. A notification appeared in his mind as clear as day. The system informed him that he had consumed a purification potion, lifting both the state of fear and the hallucination state.

 Sumo collapsed onto the ground, panting heavily as he caught his breath. He realized he had survived the tension, slowly leaving his body.

 He took a moment to look at his new space, a sense of relief washing over him. The portal skill is indeed soapy. It's basically a cheating. And for now he was safe.

 He thought to himself how lucky he was that only those he allowed could enter the subspace fortress. Grateful for the barrier that kept the dragon pursuing him here?

 He chuckled slightly, though it was strained, reflecting on how he had bought a purification potion from the general market just in case, but never thought he'd use it so soon. Sitting up with effort, Sumo wiped the sweat from his brow. He muttered that it was harder than he thought. Reflecting on the dire situation he knew that just dispelling the dragon's fear wouldn't give him resistance to it. Not right away. Cure spells were ineffective, meaning he'd have to keep retreating to this fortress and using purification potions over and over.

 He frowned, realizing that at this rate, he wouldn't be able to defeat the Dragon.

 His gaze hardened with determination. He resolved that since it had come down to this, he needed a new plan.

 He summoned a guitar, a broom and an old book from his inventory. He narrowed his eyes thoughtfully, getting help from the mad, pulverized Asian scholar

 with mystical energy swirling around a magical circle. Sue Ho took the skill book and leaned, focusing on learning the spell. The system confirmed his progress, indicating that he had learned the basic combination formula through the skill book.

 A large jar appeared before him,

 and Sumo's confidence grew as he examined the jar, noting to himself that a combination recipe with an absolute formula would inevitably succeed, even if it was the most basic one.

 These were items commonly referred to as junk, he thought. His fingers brushing over the objects. But it's a hidden gem for people who know how to use it.

 He began placing the items into the jar, and his heart pounded with anticipation as the system announced the start of the combination process.

 Sumo watched the jar, its glow growing brighter and more intense.

 Suddenly, the jar emitted a burst of golden light, filling the entire with warmth.

 The system notified him that his combination was successful. He gazed down at the jar as the light began to fade,

 revealing a rare treasure floating within a dazzling ring emitting a mystical aura. The system announced that a rare treasure had been created from the lowest level formula.

 Sumo reached and held the ring in his hand. A sense of accomplishment swelling in his chest.

 The system continued to provide details. It was the first Moomoo with SX plus grade. When equipped it would always apply colorless solitude.

 Sumo smiled, admiring the ring as he slid it on to his finger, feeling pride that if he successfully combined an item marked as first ever, he would receive bonus stats.

 So basically because Moon moves item would always be SX grade, the first ever title would rank it to S plus.

 He looked at the ring feeling its power surge through him. He realized once again how prudent the privileges of a regressed were.

 The first Moomoo was the kind of treasure that would grow, with him becoming even more powerful over time.

 Sumo then summoned status window ready to proceed with his plan.

 He invested four points into the magic stat and the rest into strength and stamina. He confirmed the allocation. Watching As the system responded,

 notifying him that his magic stat had reached 100 and had grown even further. It congratulated him as his magic stat leveled up to read.

 Sumo smiled, noting that it was the first time he had obtained a red stat while still below level 50. Realizing his growth was definitely fast,

 the color systems rank by one every time it reaches 100. He knew his purple rank before regression needed 700 points to unlock and was still a long way off. But he was determined that this time he might be able to aim for a level beyond purple.

 Sumo stood his resolve firm, thinking that the stat distribution was now complete.

 He raised his hand summoning the next thing he needed the spear. The system announced the summoning of the old spear.

 Sumo gripped the spear tightly, his eyes reflecting his determination. He thought it was time to wake up the spear,

 channeling his magical power into it. The room lit up with a brilliant light as the spear began to react, its consciousness slowly awakening,

 Sumo grimaced as he felt the spear draw heavily from his mana. The absorption nearly overwhelming.

 He muttered that as expected, the absorption capacity was huge. His body tensing from the strain.

 The spear glowed with intense energy, its power growing stronger with each passing moment.

 Sumo could feel the reaction, the spear inching closer to its full awakening. He gritted his teeth, pouring every ounce of his energy into it, thinking that the reaction was starting and he just needed a bit.

 Finally, the system notified him that the unknown spear was gaining consciousness, congratulating him on partially awakening its consciousness.

 Sumo had obtained the Shadow Spear, a plus rank.

 He smiled confidently, his eyes narrowing as he looked ahead, ready for round two to begin.

 The shadow spear glowed with an ominous purple light swirling, shadows wrapping around its shaft. As Sumo stood still for a moment, assessing the weapon, the system notification pops out, explaining its origins. The spear was one of the shadow Lords treasures crafted from the bones of a shadow beast. Its power was immense, allowing the wielder to summon it from the shadows whenever needed. And even repair it using the surrounding darkness.

 Sumo considered its potential feeling a rush of satisfaction

 if Jang Pyong had the subspace fortress. Then the Shadow Lord, a monarch of spirits, had this shadow spear. He eventually became as notorious as Jong Pyong. Ho becoming major criminal in the past, and Su Ho was glad it had fallen into his grasp before anyone else, especially before it could be used for evil again.

 Sumo stood in an opulent room, ready to test the spears power. He swung it with ease. The shadows swirling around as if they were alive.

 He extended his hand

 and the spear returned to him in an instant. Shadow summon, he murmured. The ability to recall the spear whenever he needed would be useful.

 A reassuring thought, especially for what lay ahead.

 A portal opened in front of him, revealing a massive dragon resting in a deserted landscape. Its scales glinting ominously

 sumo assess the situation, understanding that a direct confrontation could end poorly. The dragon's power was evident even from this distance, but it was resting. That meant he had an opportunity. He decided to use the advantage of surprise to deal as much damage as possible before the beast could react.

 Su ho's foot sparked with energy as he dashed forward, closing the distance an instant.

 He stopped at a good position and gripped the shadow spear, tightly focusing his magical energy into it.

 The shadows thickened around him, swirling and faster.

 He felt his pulse quickened, excitement mixing with determination.

 He charged forward with the spear, aiming directly for the dragon's weak spot. Shadow strike. Su Ho yelled, the spear, releasing a powerful surge of energy as he swung it down.

 The attack hit the dragon with precision and the ground beneath them shook the impact.

 The dragon's eyes snapped open. Glowing with fierce anger,

 it reared its head back, letting out a deafening roar that reverberated through the arena. The tower dragon was enraged. Its eyes glowed and Sumo could see its scales trembling from the pain of his attack.

 He leaped back, preparing himself for what would come next.

 The dragon released a powerful wave of fear. The oppressive aura spreading throughout the area. Su Ho's instincts screamed at him to flee, but he managed to dive into his subspace fortress just in time.

 He caught his breath looking at the massive beast through the portal.

 He smirked, holding on the shadow spear tightly. He had avoided the status effects by entering the fortress, and now he would keep repeating his hit and run tactic until the beast fell.

 After a while, the dragons eye glowed menacingly, its fury growing as Sumo kept doing his tactic.

 This time, however, the reverse scale was cracked

 and the dragon was on high, no longer letting its guard down.

 Sumo understood that the previous strategy would no longer work. He needed to face it head on.

 He dashed forward

 through his spear perfectly and pierced through the dragon's defenses, stabbing its eye until blood keeps pouring.

 The dragon roared in agony, its body cracking under the immense pressure and unleashing its fear skill.

 Sumo felt the oppressive weight of fear washing over him, momentarily losing himself in terror. But he forced himself to move, pushing the fear with a burst of energy.

 He drank a purification potion, feeling the blue liquid wash over him, neutralizing any remaining fear. He grinned, gripping the spear confidently. It won't work twice, you idiot, he shouted, his voice echoing across the battlefield

 with one last surge of energy sumo charged forward, aiming directly for the dragon's head. He gathered all his remaining power into his sword, ready to deliver the final blow.

 After unleashing his final strike, the Massive Dragon let out a deafening roar before collapsing. In the end, the Tower dragon was finally defeated.

 Sumo stood still, panting heavily, his sword quivering in his hand. The system notification appeared before him, announcing that he had conquered the 49th floor and set a new record for the Tower of Challenge. It declared his success in completing the tower and awarded him ten bonus stats. OMG, thank God. Am I the only one that tired to the dragon face? It took almost four chapters to fight it alone.

 Exhaustion swept over Sumo as he collapsed on to the cold ground. It was so tiring.

 Relief washed over him as he acknowledged to himself that he had truly achieved something remarkable. He acknowledged to himself that he accomplished something no one else had managed. Conquering the Tower of Challenge for the first time in both the past and present, the system notifications to flood his vision, each one bringing another reward.

 The system congratulated him for reaching level 40. Informed him that all levels of healer class exclusive skills had increased by one

 and announced that he had acquired a new skill called Healing Spirit. Curious about his new ability,

 Sumo opened its description. The skill would allow him to deploy a healing zone that could heal all beings within it continuously, with no limit on the number of individuals. The only requirement was a weapon to use as a totem for deployment.

 A faint smile appeared on his face as he realized the potential of this skill.

 He thought about how it could cover entire battlefields once fully leveled. Much like the abilities Isabela had used in the past

 as the system, its evaluation of his achievements, a final reward appeared.

 The notification revealed that he had received Dragon blood ranked as plus

 Sumo stared at the words in disbelief, recalling that this was the signature power of Yama, a legendary player known for unparalleled power. On of the top player in the previous timeline,

 he access the description which detailed that dragon blood allowed the user to wield dragon like powers with level one intimidation and dragon spirit to unlock level two. He needed to reach level 50 while higher levels remained locked.

 Excitement surged through him as he know what the real deal this new power he had gained. He reflected on how Yong must have obtained dragon blood from Dragon Mountain

 can't hold his joy sumo raises his hands in triumph as he celebrates this newfound strength that surely would make him stronger than ever before. Dude, how strong are you going to be? I can't imagine anymore. Are you maniac for power?

 Determined to make the most of his victory, Sumo unsheathed his shadow Spear

 and stabbed it into the dragon's shadow.

 The weapon pulsed with dark energy as it absorbed the dragon's essence.

 The system explained that the shadow spear had consumed Tower Dragon, increasing its rank to SW, plus the hidden special option. Shadow Devour had leveled up significantly,

 opening his status window, Sumo saw that all of the spear skills had advanced to rank s

 shadow binding in particular, now inflicted continuous bleeding damage on its targets.

 Impressed by the Spears growth potential, he thought to himself how different growth type weapons were compared to ordinary ones.

 As he prepared to leave the tower his eyes caught something near the dragon's remains

 picking it up. He discovered another item identified as the Mighty Dragon's Fang. The system described that those pierced the fang would be cursed with an irrecoverable status, preventing any recovery.

 Soho marveled at the rarity of such an item and realized that the tower was not merely a dragon kin, but a true pure blood dragon. Leaving Sumo in awe of his incredible rewards.

 Well, another OP reward be hurt, right?

 With his loot secured, Sumo turned to the tower and quietly bid it farewell.

 As he exit the tower. The crystal atop the tower shattered and announced to all players that the tower of Challenge had been conquered by en su ho

 forcibly expelling all remaining players

 outside. Chaos erupted as players were expelled from the tower.

 Many said that Su Ho is indeed a monster, whispering among themselves about the impossibility of conquering the tower, especially alone.

 Not far from them, media crews swarmed Sumo,

 bombarding him with questions about his feet,

 feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. He just want to kill all the people and run away.

 Sue Ho scanned the crowd until his eyes landed on something interesting.

 Jin Hui, who was seated atop a car seemingly lost in thought.

 Suddenly, Sumo reappearing silently behind Jin, we patted him on the back.

 Jin Hui nearly fell from his seat, spinning around in shock. He appeared completely unprepared for Sue Ho's sudden arrival.

 Sue Ho observed Jin Hui's reaction with amusement, silently asking, why he seemed so surprised, using his ultimate stealth skill to escape people without a trace to surprise Jin Hui is the right choice. It's fun to see him like this.

 He extended a hand to help Jin Hui steady himself, wondering aloud whether Jin Hui still doubted him.

 Jin Hui shook his head. His expression a mix of disbelief and admiration. He acknowledged that he had never doubted Sumo, insisting that he wouldn't have come to this place otherwise. As the murmurs from the crowd grew louder. Jin Hui urge Su Ho to get into the car. Before they were surrounded again

 as Sue Ho sat in the car, his phone buzzed and Tillman's name appeared on the screen.

 When Su Ho answered the call, Tillman congratulated him. Tillman expressed his amazement his achievement in conquering the Tower of Challenge, noting how many had considered it impossible. Tillman offered to send a car for him, but Sumo declined, politely explaining that he was already a friend.

 Sumo inquired if there was a specific reason for the call. Tillman hesitated before admitting it wasn't anything urgent, merely a request for Su Ho to visit the association, if possible. They wanted to ask him about how he could clear the tower. Su Jose then mentioned that even major guilds were not to such scrutiny. After clearing high level gates.

 In response, Tillman explained the unique circumstances of the Tower of Challenge, which was both publicly accessible and considered unconquerable. Tillman ended the call with warm wishes for Su Ho to rest well, and Su Ho promised to consider visiting.

 After the call ended, Su Ho leaned back in thought. Undoubtedly, the chairman or vice chairman must have requested photos of him for their benefit.

 Poor Tillman was probably just the messenger.

 His expression darkened as he recalled his past life as a hunter and the exhausting dealings with the old geezer at the Association. He knew he had to find a way to shield Tillman from their schemes once he became part of the Hunter Association

 from the driver's seat. Jin Hui broke the silence, admitting that he had been curious for a while about why someone with Su Ho's unmatched skills would choose to become a civil servant Hunter.

 Sue Ho, let out a deep sigh. He acknowledged that he knew every guild wanted him and would pay any price to recruit him. However, he emphasized that no matter how powerful a guild seemed, it couldn't match the authority and reach of a nation.

 Jin Cui pressed further, pointing out that private guilds also held immense popularity and influence.

 But Su Ho shook his head. In the end, guilds thrived on momentary achievements.

 He reflected that guilds thrived on temporary glory. Shining when revered as heroes. However, he added that as soon as they gained power through fear, they would be seen as threats by both the public and fellow players.

 Yet his ultimate goal was clear to close all Gates and end humanity's dependance on hunters. He stressed the importance of affiliation as no individual could handle all the gates alone. For him, the government was the best option to achieve this mission.

 Jin Hui nodded thoughtfully, realizing that Su Ho's true intention was securing priority in raids. Smiling, he asked if Su Ho plan to apply for public recruitment.

 But Sumo's reply startled him. He settle for a level nine field position, but aimed directly for level five. Jin Hui shock was palpable as he questioned Su ho seriousness, laughing Su Ho assured him it was no joke,

 but Jin Hui couldn't hide his disbelief and eagerly asked to hear the reason.

 Su Ho agreed. With one condition Jin, we must not publish the article about the topic and keep the secret between them. Of course Jin Hui agreed because he was damn curious.

 After hearing the reason, Su Ho's explanation left Jin Hui astonished, praising him for his brilliant ideas.

 Suhail reminded Jin Hui to keep their discussion a secret. He confidently mentioned that once he became a civil servant, he would rely on him for every future official statement.

 Sue Ho added that Jin Hui needed to rise in the ranks at his broadcast station to make that happen. Jin We can only chuckled, noting how Su Ho clearly intended to make full use of him.

 Jin Hwi then suggested that Su Ho consider staying at his apartment. He reasoned that given Su Ho's recent achievement, his information was likely now public, making his current residence inconvenient and potentially unsafe.

 He assured Sue Ho that everything was prepared for his safety, emphasizing his spacious and well-secured guest room.

 When Su ho learned the apartment was in Keizer Cheong Dam, a location infamous for its crazy prices. He was stunned.

 Maybe this was an apartment building with Taylor Swift in the penthouse. Well, guys, who knows?

 Arriving at Jin Hui's crazy Rich residence,

 Sumo's shock deepened at the sheer luxury. Is this how life is for people from privileged backgrounds?

 Inside, Jin Hui mentioned calling a healer to heal, ho

 only to gape in disbelief. Upon realizing Su Ho was already fully recovered. And Sue Ho casually him that he too was a healer.

 Jin Hui's skepticism lingered. He wondered aloud what kind of healer could possibly clear the Tower of Challenge alone.

 With a laugh, Sue Ho brushed off the doubt, reminding Jin Hui he had said it multiple times.

 As Jin Hui prepared to leave for work. He told him to the apartment. His own home

 left alone. Sue Ho opened his status window, distributing his newly earned bonus point. He think this is the right time to stamina with other attributes and invested the remaining point into sensitivity.

 The updated window displayed his new level with three red marked a result that even he found astonishing. He couldn't help but think that achieving such a status at level 40 felt almost like cheating. Dude, I'm dying here is he just realized it now.

 Once finished, Su Ho explored the apartment meticulously searching for surveillance cameras.

 He considered that while he trusted Jin Hui, it was better to be cautious. After all, this was the home of a conglomerate's youngest son.

 After inspecting every corner of the house, Sue Ho confirmed there were no surveillance cameras. The mansion was too big, and he found himself more exhausted than when he had battled the dragon

 with no prying eyes around. He finally allowed himself to relax. Keep in mind, this is the same day after he killed the dragon.

 But his phone kept buzzing, leaving him perplexed.

 Upon checking, he discovered countless messages flooding in. And even more troubling, his personal information been exposed. Strangers somehow had his number.

 He sighed, realizing the need for a new phone and

 number. After a refreshing Su ho sank into this $1 million bed, determined to rest before the evening. He had plans that demanded his full focus

 that night inside a corporate database center.

 A portal materialized.

 Some suspicious individuals wearing masks stepped through,

 ensuring nobody was around and began preparing for their mission.

 One of them threw a heavy bag onto the floor.

 And surprise, surprise, it was a bomb.

 They moved quickly, planting the bomb into the servers as they meticulously worked.

 A calm voice interrupted them. Warning against leaving bombs in such a place

 startled the terrorists, demanded to know who was there. They were sure no one was supposed to be in the building at this hour.

 Emerging from the shadows, our boy appeared Sumo nonchalantly explained he had anticipated their arrival and had come specifically to talk.

 Their leader ordered the terrorists retreat through the portal,

 but before they could leave, Sue Ho threw his spear, striking one of the terrorists to the ground.

 The others frozen shock, unable to understand what had caused their leader to fall. They couldn't see anything unusual in that place.

 As one of them rushed to help, they realized she couldn't move. Sue

 Ho had used his shadow behind skill to immobilize her.

 The girl terrorist commanded her subordinates to leave her and

 change their focus to eliminate Su Ho. Instead,

 they drew their daggers

 at him. But Su Ho didn't even flinch.

 He activated his intimidation skill without moving an inch. Immediately the terrorists collapsed. Trembling with fear.

 Calmly, Sue Ho asked if they were part of the group called Banshee, a

 secretive terrorist organization notorious for its bombings. The

 team gasped, astonished. How can Sue Ho knew their group name without offering an explanation? He strode toward them, pulling

 off their masks one by one revealing their identities.

 First was Kwok duo, the team's heavy lifter and a day laborer. Next

 was, say, Okja Okinawan, the bomb maker who led a double as a middle school science teacher. Then

 came Kim Heung Min, their transporter using his movement skill, which is portal maker to evade capture while working as a delivery driver.

 Finally, Guion Hua, the mastermind and a university student with an ability capable of disabling electronic and magical devices Janjua shaken, demanded to know how Sue Ho had uncovered their secrets.

 Su Ho smiled slyly, claiming he had his ways. He also remarked that Yong Hua surely recognized him.

 She admitted she did know him. After all, who didn't know The rookie hunter capable of clearing the Tower of Challenge. However, she was baffled by his presence at their operation, unable to find any flaw in their plan.

 Sue Ho then crouched in front of her, observing closely. As expected, she was quick to assess the situation and adapt.

 Thus, Sue Ho activated his intimidation skill again, amplifying his aura. Jinhua fell to the ground, her entire body trembling as the overwhelming fear gripped here tight. This fear is no joke, even for her.

 Sue Ho began to listed their crimes. Three terrorist attacks, including tonight's which, although avoiding civilian casualties, had caused significant property damage. He noted that thanks to Yan was MP ability, the police had no leads to find them,

 but he had trick that can track them down effortlessly. He knew everything. How they operated, erased their traces and even the identities of their family. So if they don't want to harm their family, they need to cooperate now.

 Cornered Young Hua offered to answer all Sue Ho's questions if he spared her team and her family.

 Sue leaned in his face inches from hers. He grinned and remarked that she was finally ready to talk.

 Sue Ho then addressed the group, clarifying that he was not affiliated with the government and had no intention of arresting or harming them. He asked whether that was sufficient as an introduction or not.

 Yana, however, keeps skeptical, questioning how Su ho expected them to believe him. Sue Ho sighed, expressing disappointment that they couldn't be reasoned with.

 He suggested that if things continued this way, it might be better to hand them over to the police. His gaze lingered on Yong Hua, making it clear that their fate depended entirely on them, whether they chose to trust him or preferred the alternative. Faced with limited options, John Hua reluctantly asked what Sue ho truly wanted from them.

 Standing up, Sue Ho proposed that they move to another location to talk and insisted that they dismantle and bring along all the bombs had planted. He suggested their hideout would be an ideal place to continue the conversation.

 Realizing that Sue Ho also knew their hideout, Yong Hua couldn't hide her disbelief. She wondered just how much Su ho knew about them

 without answering directly. Soho called out to Hinman, instructing him to open a portal.

 As human opened the portal, Sue Ho commented that there was no time to waste taking a taxi.

 Once at their hideout, Sue Ho demanded that they remove their masks. They initially resisted,

 but the group eventually complied after a sharp death stare from Su Ho, driving them with fear.

 In the end, Yong was frustrated and boiled over as she demanded to know how Sue Ho had discovered their location and why he had appeared before them. When his reputation suggested his focus was solely on conquering gates.

 Suhail responded with a wry smile, explaining that he had used his abilities to uncover all their secrets, including their plans for criminal activities. He pressed further revealed his true intention. He wanted them to work for him.

 If they saw the article about him, they would surely know he intended to join. The Hunter Association and he need them for this purpose.

 Yang was. Anger erupted at this audacious proposal, accusing Sue Ho of planning to hand them over to the to secure a special recruitment position.

 Yet Suhail calmly reassured her that he had no intention of betraying them and asked if they could hear him out.

 He then outlined his plan. He intended to take the level five exam, transitioned through a few positions, and ultimately join the Special Forces unit.

 This revelation provoked a sudden angry reaction from the group, clearly demonstrating their deep hatred for the Special Forces.

 Sue Ho explained that he knew their entire history of targeting locations tied to the Special Forces unit and how their hatred had festered to the point of leading them to terrorism. All of it stemming from this grudge.

 Su Ho acknowledged their anger. Stating that his motivations were the same as theirs. They shared a similar reason.

 Like them, he was a gate orphan. He admitted that at first he had believed his suffering was a misfortune.

 However, he later discovered that the disaster he endured had been deliberately engineered. The government, fully aware of the impending gate shock, had chosen not to act, prioritizing development projects tied to the area. Instead,

 with a determined expression, Soho declared his intent to rise within the Special Forces unit to make those responsible pay what they deserved. However, as the Special Forces Unit held a strong position and significant control within the Hunter Association, he realized he needed their.

 He promised to aid in their quest for revenge, ensuring it was precise and certain, but they needed to prepare everything under his guidance.

 But Jianguo questioned Sue Ho's confidence in passing the Level five exam. It wouldn't be that easy, even for him

 with a firm determination. Sue Ho suggesting they could decide to follow him only if he succeeded. However, he warned that any criminal activity during this time would nullify his proposal and prompt him to hand them over to the authorities without hesitation.

 Sue Ho stood ready to leave, acknowledging the shock his proposal must have caused

 the Banshee, known for its anonymity, was now exposed before him. Their plan to strike the Special Forces Unit had also been discovered. Of Course, they would be confused by now.

 He smirked, remarking that in his past life it had been a monumental challenge to apprehend Banshee members

 through their interrogation. He had learned crucial details about them,

 reflecting on their shared circumstances. He believed their anger had festered into hatred, leading them down a path terrorism.

 If only someone had guided Banshee earlier. Their trajectory might have been different

 with a resolute expression. Sue Ho committed to setting them on a better path. He would give them as much time as they needed to decide, but he was confident Yong WA would eventually accept his offer. His skills were undeniable. After all, there was no better choice than to accept his proposal

 with a faint smile. He departed, wishing them to make a wise choice in their decision.

 Meanwhile, at the Korean Hunter Association,

 Chilman was enduring a scolding from his superior, apologizing profusely. He kept saying sorry because he couldn't bring Su Ho to meet his boss.

 After that, he eventually left the office, weighed down by the heavy scolding he had endured for hours

 outside. He suddenly has a mental crisis, questioning whether he should abandon his position and join a civilian guild.

 However, his dedication to his vision kept him here even after he had already endured so much over the years. He couldn't just quit like this

 as he wrestled with his thoughts. A hand suddenly rested on his shoulder,

 turning. He found himself face to face with Chief personal of the Special Forces Unit. Internally, he panicked. What a bad luck. After getting scolded hours now, he had to face this guy.

 Chief Pi noted that everyone in the association had heard about the scolding, and he had come here to offer encouragement.

 He congratulated Chilman for enduring the scolding from the old man earlier. He acknowledged how draining it must have been and inquired about the reason behind it.

 Hesitated before admitting that the reprimand stemmed from a misunderstanding involving Su Ho, Chief Pye raised an eyebrow, noting that he had heard the issue was indeed caused by a rookie called SWO. However, Chilman clarified that Su Ho wasn't directly responsible, but that Chilman had failed to bring Su Ho to the association, which had escalated the situation.

 Hearing this, Chief PI's expression turned contemplative, He mentioned that he could help resolve the issue, leaving Chilman surprised

 when Chilman asked how Chief P explained that summoning someone to the association was not as complicated as it seemed. All they needed was to issue Su ho a pen and charge to bring him to the association. Once there the situation be addressed and any misunderstandings cleared up. Chilman was shocked to hear that. He added that Sue Ho was someone they should aim to leave a good impression on.

 But Chief Pi smirked,

 emphasizing that the association president would release Sudo, who had been summoned for questioning and then give him surprise. This would resolve neatly, he added.

 His sharp gaze met Shulman's remark that Su Ho likely had intentions of registering with the association anyway. Wouldn't this solution benefit everyone involved? On the other side, this absurd suggestion made Chilman visibly anxious,

 laughing nervously. Chilman dismissed it as one of Chief peer's mischievous jokes. He explained that using such forceful methods against someone as accomplished as Sue Ho could lead to disastrous consequences.

 Chief P's lips curled into a sardonic smile as he commented that every time he looked at Chilman, he couldn't help but think of what a genuinely good person Chilman was. He sarcastically wondered why the government should fear a single hunter. They have the power to trample everyone. So they should hold their heads high.

 Want to end this bullshit? Chilman only nodded.

 Chief Pye, however, leaned in with a more earnest expression. He encouraged Chilman to think things through, carefully reminding him of the association's authority to investigate and prosecute hunters.

 He pointed out the historical power of prosecutors and how fear of their authority used to keep people in check. Chilman listened quietly as Chief Pi urged him to adopt a more flexible mindset, emphasizing that as members of the association, they need not fear anyone.

 Sometimes unconventional methods were necessary to achieve results, he explained.

 Before leaving, Chief Pye reassured Chilman that he was always available to provide assistance if needed.

 As chief, he walked away. Chilman watched him in disbelief, to be honest. Me too. I'm also in disbelief, guys. I bet he would get wrecked by Cujo in the future. Back to Chilman. A mix of emotions swirled within him and he muttered under his breath, calling the man sneaky.

 Initially, Tolman had thought Chief Pie would be different from his knowledgable superiors, especially as he was one of the hunters working within the association.

 But he soon realized that Chief Pie's deep understanding of hunters and their mindset allowed him to exploit loopholes for his own gain.

 This revelation could only leave Chilman with a bitter taste.

 Stepping outside the association's building, Chilman decided to take a moment to rest.

 His thoughts drifted to Soho. He wondered why Sue Ho would seem cooperative with the association in the first place,

 suddenly appeared distant during their recent phone call.

 Perhaps Chilman the allure of offers from powerful guilds had drawn Su ho away, making him reconsider his desire to work for the association.

 Looking up the sky, Chilman found himself questioning Soho's real motives and decisions.

 Meanwhile, in another part of the city, Sue Ho exited a taxi,

 fully equipped in his new gear. The first Moomoo,

 the systems voice echoed in his mind, announcing the activation of monochrome solitude,

 feeling he had completed all his preparations. Super clenched his fist and decided to move forward with his next plan.

 He climbed over a fence and entered an abandoned building.

 He then looked around as he scanned his surroundings with magic detection.

 A faint trail of dark manna appeared, leading him to a narrow hallway. He to himself, noting how gaits inherently emit a large amount of mana. So no matter how well-hidden they are, they still leak magical power. And by looking at this kind of mana flowing around, he considered that his next gate had already appeared here.

 Following the trail, he found a hidden gate. It was sealed and inactive, shrouded in a magical aura that blended into the air around it.

 He recognized the gate as a hidden dungeon, requiring conditions to unlock. Drawing a knife from his inventory, Soho's lips curved into a smirk.

 He then made a shallow cut on his palm, letting a few drops of blood fall on to the gate.

 The system's voice confirmed that the condition had been met and the gate began to open.

 A notification informed Soho of his discovery. He had located a hidden gate and achieved a remarkable milestone, earning five bonus stats as a reward.

 As the gate revealed its name. Blood's Decree, the system displayed additional information. Entry conditions and maximum capacity remained unknown.

 Soho gazed at the swirling energy of the opened gate, his smirk deepening as he prepared to step into this dungeon. Whatever lay ahead, he was ready to face it head on.
